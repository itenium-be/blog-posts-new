      <title>Joy of Agility: How to Solve Problems and Succeed Sooner</title>
    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this book, Joshua Kerievsky tries to answer a key question: what does it actually look like to <em>be</em> agile, rather than merely <em>do</em> agile?
This distinction immediately piqued my curiosity. Having worked as a software engineering consultant since 2010, I’ve witnessed the full spectrum of agile implementations, from the genuinely transformative to those where organisations cherry-picked the convenient bits. Kerievsky’s promise of a return to first principles through storytelling felt like precisely the perspective our industry needs.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="structure-and-approach">Structure and approach</h2>

<p>Kerievsky organises his exploration of agility around six interconnected paradigms:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Be Quick, Don’t Hurry</strong> – Distinguishing between genuine speed and reckless haste</li>
  <li><strong>Grace</strong> – Gaining better balance and collaborating gracefully with others</li>
  <li><strong>Readiness</strong> – Preparing and practising to be poised to adapt</li>
  <li><strong>Resilience</strong> – Taking deliberate steps to drive out fear</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> – Growing a solution by starting minimal and evolving</li>
  <li><strong>Resourcefulness</strong> – Overcoming obstacles by being readily inventive</li>
</ol>

<p>What makes this book distinctive is its narrative approach. Rather than prescribing yet another framework or process, Kerievsky explores one or more paradigms through a collection of standalone stories which are drawn from a wide diversity of fields. The diversity of fields is something that immediately appealed to my personal curiosity and helps showcase that the agile process is truly widely applicable.</p>

<p>This structure allows one to dip back into specific sections for inspiration when facing particular challenges. Found yourself rushing a release? Revisit the stories on being quick without hurrying. Team paralysed by fear of failure? The resilience section offers practical wisdom. The bite-sized setup also enables me to easily discuss one of them during a knowledge-sharing meeting, or even while waiting for a beverage.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>

<p>The book’s greatest strength lies in its accessibility. Kerievsky writes with genuine passion, and his advocacy for joy in work is particularly refreshing in an era where we tend to focus on velocity metrics and burndown charts. He reminds us that agility should lead not merely to better software, but to a more fulfilling experience for everyone involved. Agile or scrum metrics should not be used merely to prove Goodhart’s law (<code>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure</code>).</p>

<p>The practical nature of this book makes it easy to draw inspiration for solutions from the stories and to recommend it to a wide audience, be it a junior programmer, a senior QA tester, or just a random colleague. Everyone can find a kernel of wisdom in it.</p>

<p>Kerievsky also cites other well-known figures in the field, which strengthens his message.</p>

<h2 id="a-minor-nitpick">A minor nitpick</h2>

<p>One of the book’s major strengths occasionally works against its cohesion. The standalone, short nature of the stories may not offer the interwoven experience that some readers expect. While the takeaway at the end of each story is certainly helpful, explicitly identifying any secondary paradigms would be a valuable addition. This would help those less familiar with agile concepts to better navigate the interlinked themes.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-read-this-book">Who should read this book?</h2>

<p><em>The Joy of Agility</em> is ideal for those who prefer learning through practical stories rather than at times dry methodology. The more nuanced and practical stories will also appeal to those who might have become somewhat jaded by more dogmatic resources. It’s a book that I can recommend to seniors to draw inspiration from and to juniors to learn what being agile truly means.</p>

<p>For those of us who’ve witnessed agile’s promise diluted by poor implementation, Kerievsky’s work serves as a welcome reminder of what we’re actually striving for: not adherence to a process, but the cultivation of a mindset which embraces adaptability, collaboration, and yes, joy.</p>

<h2 id="other-recommended-books">Other recommended books</h2>

<p>People who enjoyed this book will likely also appreciate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>97 Things Every Scrum Practitioner Should Know</strong> (Edited by Gunther Verheyen): Much like this collection, Kerievsky emphasises that agility is a culture of continuous improvement. Both works suggest that the most effective processes are those that empower the people doing the work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Refactoring</strong> (by Martin Fowler): The focus on Versatility and Readiness mirrors Fowler’s technical philosophy. It reminds us that internal quality is what provides the external “grace” needed to pivot when a product’s direction changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Pragmatic Programmer</strong> (by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas): This book shares the same “common sense” approach to excellence. It focuses on the developer’s mindset and the importance of having a diverse “toolbelt” of techniques.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Extreme Programming Explained</strong> (by Kent Beck): The emphasis on Resilience and Proactivity echoes Beck’s early assertions that technical discipline is the key to both speed and team well-being.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><em>The Joy of Agility</em> is not another agile methodology book, but a manifesto that inspires us.
It’s a recommended read for anyone genuinely interested in what it means to be agile, rather than merely doing agile.</p>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>I have just finished reading <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781098143220/"><em>Fundamentals of Software Engineering: From Coder to Engineer</em></a>, and it immediately took me back to my early days in the industry. I vividly recall that moment when I first joined a professional team: I knew how to write code, having learned the fundamentals in college, but I quickly discovered that being a software engineer involves a lot more than purely coding.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="welcome-to-the-full-software-development-lifecycle">Welcome to the full Software Development Lifecycle</h2>

<p>An activity that, as many of us can attest, is quite frequently the minority of our day. Suddenly, I was faced with the full reality of the Software Development Lifecycle, from figuring out why a massive service is slow to navigating team processes and even the occasional bit of office politics. It felt profoundly overwhelming, especially as I slowly started realising how many crucial practices I didn’t even know I was missing.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-things-no-one-teaches-you">The things no one teaches you</h2>

<p>This book aims to tackle that challenge. It is an ideal companion for early-to-mid-career developers, whether they come from a traditional Computer Science degree, are self-taught, or followed an intensive bootcamp. Your  training gave you the <em>tools</em> (algorithms, syntax), but this book provides the <em>instruction manual</em> for jumpstarting your transition from a coder to an engineer. It will answer many of the questions that you might have that others will view as so-called “common” knowledge and might not even think about mentioning.</p>

<h2 id="real-world-advice-from-seasoned-practitioners">Real-World advice from seasoned practitioners</h2>

<p>It’s written by Nathaniel Schutta and Dan Vega, two well-regarded figures in the industry. Schutta’s background in software architecture and Vega’s experience as a Spring Developer Advocate help create a pragmatic guide that will help you navigate many of the common pitfalls, be it how to start grasping the codebase (documentation, navigating it, meetings, and so on), the social aspect (politics, meetings, different personal approaches, work-life balance, and so forth), et cetera.</p>

<h2 id="surfacing-the-unknown-unknowns">Surfacing the unknown unknowns</h2>

<p>Crucially, it is important to note that this book doesn’t claim to teach you absolutely everything required to be a senior engineer; no single title could. Instead, its greatest strength lies in highlighting the “unknown unknowns.” For a junior developer, the most significant obstacles are often the concepts they don’t yet know they need to master, from CI/CD pipelines to architectural drivers, and from effective data handling to code refactoring. The book acts as a comprehensive map of the territory, ensuring they understand <em>what</em> they need to investigate next. The clear chapter layout makes it easy to skip to a specific section if you have a particular need, although I strongly recommend reading the whole book for context.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-code-people-process-and-balance">Beyond Code: people, process, and balance</h2>

<p>Beyond the technical skills, such as automated testing and moving to production, I was quite pleased to also see an emphasis on the human side of the craft. The latter is often overlooked, despite how vital these skills are for both our personal well-being and smooth collaboration with everyone. This makes the book a useful guide for anyone feeling slightly overwhelmed by the complexity of modern software delivery, regardless of their educational background. It truly gives the reader the structure to power up their productivity and start <em>engineering</em> solutions.</p>

<h2 id="recommended-resources">Recommended resources</h2>

<p>After having read the book, I recommend checking these out:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>The Software Engineer’s Guidebook</em> by Gergely Orosz: The book serves as a definitive guide to career progression, laying out the concrete expectations for Senior, Staff, and Principal engineers in a structured, actionable way. It is born from the author’s determination to provide clear feedback and support often missing when aiming for the next level. Where Schutta and Vega establish the engineering foundation, Orosz details how to convert that competence into career advancement.</li>
  <li><em>The Missing README</em> by Chris Riccomini and Dmitriy Ryaboy: For practical day-to-day operations and a similar “field guide” approach, this is an excellent companion.</li>
  <li><em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> by John Ousterhout: If the architectural and design principles in <em>Fundamentals</em> piqued your interest, consider this title, which provides a slightly more advanced dive into managing complexity in code.</li>
</ul>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="-highlights--trends">🎬 Highlights &amp; Trends</h2>

<p>Devoxx Belgium 2025 is a wrap, and it was an edition to remember, with an unmistakable focus on the next evolution in software: <strong>AI Agents</strong> and the modern <strong>Java 25</strong> ecosystem.
It is a real treat that the organization put the talks online so quickly, allowing us to dive straight into popular and pressing topics like the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>, <strong>Stable Values</strong>, and <strong>Structured Concurrency</strong>.
I’ve since done a deep-dive into the talks, and after some necessary wrestling, this is my top five.
This certainly doesn’t take away from the other talks; as always, the quality was amazing.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h3 id="1-top-10-event-driven-architecture-pitfalls">1. Top 10 Event-Driven Architecture Pitfalls</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Victor Rentea<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SnuppAHOlQ">Youtube Video</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Welcome to the Event-Driven Adventure Park!”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
Victor Rentea presents typical pitfalls within Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) not as dry theory, but as wild attractions in an amusement park. He covers complex distribution problems such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The “Dual Write” nightmare:</strong> The problem of atomically saving to a database <em>and</em> sending a message.</li>
  <li><strong>Race Conditions:</strong> When messages arrive or are processed in the wrong order.</li>
  <li><strong>The “Poison Pill”:</strong> A message that crashes the consumer and is endlessly redelivered.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why watch:</strong>
This is absolutely not dry material. In his typical humorous and energetic style, Victor makes abstract problems very concrete. Definitely a must for developers interested in <em>war stories</em> who want to avoid the practical pain points of messaging systems.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="2-making-significant-software-architecture-decisions">2. Making significant Software Architecture decisions</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Bert Jan Schrijver<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoV7d2Af2tM">Youtube Video</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
Bert Jan presents the complex process of making architectural choices. He warns against “Resume Driven Development” and introduces models to make decisions more objective. A key point is the <strong>“Seagull Architecture”</strong> anti-pattern: the architect who flies in, drops some decisions, and flies off again without bearing the consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Extra insights:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Every choice is a sacrifice (e.g., consistency vs. availability).</li>
  <li><strong>ADRs (Architecture Decision Records):</strong> The importance of documenting <em>why</em> a choice was made.</li>
  <li><strong>Fitness Functions:</strong> Automatically testing whether your architecture still complies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why watch:</strong>
A beautifully structured, non-dogmatic talk that leans on years of experience. If you are interested in the <em>why</em> behind the <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> of decisions, this is highly recommended.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-the-new-java-best-practices">3. The New Java Best Practices</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Stephen Colebourne<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sjJmKXLnuY">Youtube Video</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
Stephen Colebourne gives a handy overview of how we should be writing Java <em>now</em>, as opposed to the older styles many still use.</p>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Var:</strong> Use <code>var</code> for local variables to increase readability.</li>
  <li><strong>Records vs. Beans:</strong> Use <em>Records</em> for transparent data and classic <em>Beans</em> for encapsulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Switch Expressions &amp; Pattern Matching:</strong> For more concise and safer code.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Use <code>Optional</code> strictly as a return type.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why watch:</strong>
An essential update if you don’t want to get stuck in “legacy” Java patterns.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-the-imperfect-architect">4. The imperfect architect</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Robin Custers<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQWWkaSEmVo">Youtube Video</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
Robin discusses the soft side of the architect profession and the organizational challenges:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Capital:</strong> View influence as a bank account; build up credit and spend it wisely.</li>
  <li><strong>Situational Leadership:</strong> Adapt your leadership style to the team.</li>
  <li><strong>Stakeholders:</strong> How to deal with resistance and forge alliances.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why watch:</strong>
The perfect architect does not exist. This talk shows how to cultivate a collaborative culture without being dogmatic.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-domain-centric-why-hexagonal-onion-and-clean-architecture-are-answers-to-the-wrong-question">5. Domain-centric? Why Hexagonal, Onion and Clean architecture are answers to the wrong question</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Oliver Drotbohm<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co3acmgP2Ng">Youtube Video</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
Oliver Drotbohm raises critical questions about the hype surrounding Hexagonal and Clean architecture. He questions whether strictly separating technical layers actually serves the right goal.</p>

<p><strong>Core message:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Functional vs. Technical:</strong> Focus on <em>vertical slices</em> (functionality) instead of horizontal layers.</li>
  <li><strong>Modules:</strong> A plea for pragmatic API design (including with <strong>Spring Modulith</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Use Java’s package scope effectively instead of making everything public.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why watch:</strong>
A refreshing look that makes you think: how much abstraction do you <em>really</em> need?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="honourable-mention-backlogmd---reaching-95-task-success-rate-with-ai-agents">Honourable Mention: Backlog.md - Reaching 95% Task success rate with AI Agents</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Alex Gavrilescu<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSoDQU_9MMA">Youtube Video</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
In this talk, Alex explains how he successfully uses AI agents for software development, ranging from initial frustrations to a structured process.</p>

<p><strong>The Concept:</strong>
He introduces <strong>Backlog.md</strong>, where tasks live in markdown files within your git repo.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Context Management:</strong> Small, specific tasks prevent the AI from losing track.</li>
  <li><strong>Spec-Driven Development:</strong> First generate a plan, review it, and only then code.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why watch:</strong>
An honest look at the stumbling blocks of AI coding and how to solve them. The project can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md">https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md</a></p>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2019 I created a Chrome Extension called
“<a href="/blog/javascript/starify-github-links/">Starify Github Links</a>”.</p>

<p>I probably just discovered <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">sindresorhus awesome</a> lists.
And while awesome lists are, well, awesome, the problem is that while it has so many truly excellent
links, some random guy that created a really niche thing easily ends up in there as well.</p>

<p>So how do you know what to spend your time on, GitHub stars, obviously!</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>And that is what this extension did, add star badges to GitHub repository links 😀</p>

<h2 id="not-my-first-rodeo">Not my first rodeo</h2>

<p>I had already quite some experience with UserScripts / ContentScripts / Greasemonkey Scripts.
Back in the day, I got myself fooled into starting to play Tribal Wars. But… For a game that only
had a web interface, it had a pretty bad one.</p>

<p>So I created a UserScript called the <a href="https://github.com/SanguPackage/Script">Sangu Package</a>
(for Opera, Firefox and Chrome) that rectified all that; making the UI more user friendly,
more consistent, more powerful.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="one-star">One Star</h2>

<p>And that is how I ended up with one rating, a one star review for the “Starify Github Links”…
Unlike the current two competitors (which arrived years after my extension, I’d like to add!)
which just add the badge and be done with it, I was integrating it nicely to existing pages.</p>

<p>At some point Google changed their layout and it broke the extension. Someone installed it
and I got that one star review, after which no one bothered installing it anymore.</p>

<p>Maybe rightfully so, as it took me about 2 years before I got around fixing it 😀</p>

<h2 id="easy-implementation">Easy Implementation</h2>

<p>If you do the easy implementation, as for example with <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/github-star-count/jahogeehepfohgakggfeeimokcgnmdid">Github Star Count</a>, you get this on Google:</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/starify-links-easy.png" alt="Starify - The Easy Way" /></p>

<p>But that is just unacceptable, so this is what “Starify Links” does, which <strong>will break</strong>
again at some point in the future 😓</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/starify-links-hard.png" alt="Starify - The Hard Way" /></p>

<h2 id="flocking">Flocking</h2>

<p>That extension still had 200 installs, so much more than my current 34,
so something had to be done!</p>

<h2 id="whats-new">What’s New</h2>

<p>So what’s new, what I did to convince people to use my extension instead…
or maybe just because once I get started, I just can’t seem to stop myself 😀</p>

<ul>
  <li>Activate directly on websites where it makes sense</li>
  <li>Activate with a click or a (configurable) shortcut</li>
  <li>Support all the badges that seem worthwhile</li>
  <li>Make everything configurable</li>
</ul>

<p>The badges are provided by <a href="https://shields.io/">shields.io</a>.</p>

<p>For the GitHub badges if you ever see “<a href="https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/11496">Unable to select next GitHub token from pool</a>”
help them out by authorizing their <a href="https://img.shields.io/github-auth">OAuth Application</a>.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-claude">Thanks Claude</h2>

<p>I had to do some things before starting all that because the current code base
was, well, just the one js file.</p>

<p>The things that Claude did for me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>After I renamed the file to <code>.ts</code>, it adjusted the <code>gulpfile</code> to convert it to <code>.js</code>
    <ul>
      <li>I did the Typescript types myself, but I’m guessing that Claude could have done this for me too!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Split the single source file into many files
    <ul>
      <li>It chose rollup and configured it for me</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Turned my hardcoded shortcut into a configurable <code>chrome://extensions/shortcuts</code></li>
  <li>Turned the extension icon into a “Starify Links” activator</li>
  <li>Added Playwright tests with both fixed html pages as well as tests on actual sites</li>
  <li>Made these tests execute with a Github Action
    <ul>
      <li>Testing on actual sites didn’t work out of the box, but this was fixed with one additional prompt</li>
      <li>Added a cron job to run the tests daily</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I introduced some design to allow badges other than repository links
    <ul>
      <li>After that Claude managed to add other badges with me just providing the link to the shields.io badge url</li>
      <li>It didn’t work for all the badges, but it did work straight away for almost all of them</li>
      <li>Update: I went back in history and asked Claude to introduce the necessary design – and it generated something very much like what I did manually!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As soon as I asked it for some actual functional implementation, it fell short; the implementations were naive.
I’m not sure if it would be able to figure it out eventually, as at that point I just took over
and coded those parts myself.</p>

<h3 id="generated-options-page">Generated Options Page</h3>

<p>The configuration screens were a great success for Claude, it pretty much built it
without me doing any work, and all that in about 10-15 prompts.</p>

<p>This is what it generated for configuring the badges!</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/starify-links-options.png" alt="Configure all badges options screen" title="Configure all the badges!" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>But then when I was starting to trust it and just gave it a pretty big prompt and went for coffee,
I came back to “<em>API Error: 400 due to tool use concurrency issues. Run /rewind to recover the conversation.</em>”
While <code>/rewind</code> no longer exists, a simple “<em>You failed. Can you try to continue where you left off?</em>” was all it
took to get it back on track!</p>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>Needed to get around installing <code>git lfs</code> because I’m adding
large media files to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> which
I’m syncing with a private github repository.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">
    <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs" style="margin-right: 6px">

    </a>
    <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs">git-lfs/git-lfs</a>:
        Git extension for versioning large files</p>

<p>It stores your large files on a separate server and works
seamlessly with your normal git workflow.</p>

<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="install">Install</h2>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">choco install git-lfs -y
git lfs install
</code></pre>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">git lfs track "*.mp4"
</code></pre>

<p>This will create/update your <code>.gitattributes</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">*.mp4 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
</code></pre>

<p class="notice--info">Note the quotes around “*.mp4”, without them your shell will
expand and add individual file entries to <code>.gitattributes</code>!</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>It will also add git hooks for <code>pre-push</code> etc:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/sh
command -v git-lfs &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || { echo &gt;&amp;2 "\nThis repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path. If you no longer wish to use Git LFS, remove this hook by deleting .git/hooks/pre-push.\n"; exit 2; }
git lfs pre-push "$@"
</code></pre>

<p>You only need to do a <code>git lfs install</code> once. LFS will add the hooks for you when cloning
a repository with LFS content.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>If you’re going to clone or pull something with a lot of big lfs files, you can
speed up the process by batch downloading the files.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git lfs clone
</code></pre>

<p>For a pull you can use this alias to pull without lfs files and then download them separately.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git config --global alias.plfs "!git -c filter.lfs.smudge= -c filter.lfs.required=false pull &amp;&amp; git lfs pull"
</code></pre>

<h3 id="what">What!?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>-c</code>: overrides configuration for this command only
    <ul>
      <li>Example: <code>git -c user.email="me@company.com" commit -m "Fix bug"</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>filter.lfs.smudge=</code>: the default value is <code>git-lfs smudge -- %f</code> which converts the LFS pointer stored in git with the actual file from the LFS server. We’re setting this to nothing so that it doesn’t do so</li>
  <li><code>filter.lfs.required=false</code>: mark lfs files as optional</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>See all lfs related settings, with any of:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">git config --list | ? { $_ -like "filter.lfs*" }
git config --list | grep filter.lfs
git config --get-regexp 'filter\.lfs'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="github">Github</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Github currently doesn’t allow files &gt;2GB.</li>
  <li>A remote LFS object can only be deleted by deleting the whole repository.</li>
  <li>An error starting from 100MB and a warning from 50MB.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-text">remote: warning: See https://gh.io/lfs for more information.
remote: warning: File x.mp4 is 57.88 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB

<p>The <a href="https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/exclude-jekyll-feed-in-development-environment/2681/4">solution</a>
was really simple, really. And was committed in the README as a TODO over 3 years ago.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="upgrade-jekyll">Upgrade Jekyll</h2>

<p>Upgrading Jekyll from v3.9.0 to 4.2.2 already brought the
reload time down from <strong>20s to 12s</strong>.</p>

<p>After updating the <code>Gemfile</code>, I also had to upgrade a few other gems:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">gem "jekyll", "4.2.2"

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "kramdown-parser-gfm"
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~&gt; 0.17"
  gem "jekyll-paginate", "~&gt; 1.1.0"
  gem "jemoji", "~&gt; 0.13.0"
  gem "jekyll-gist", "~&gt; 1.5.0"
  gem "jekyll-avatar", "~&gt; 0.8.0"
  gem "jekyll-redirect-from"
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then apply the changes with <code>bundle update</code>.</p>

<p>There probably isn’t much you have to do when <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/3-to-4/">upgrading from v3 to v4</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ruby -v</code> needs to be &gt;=2.7.0</li>
  <li><code>{{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url some-post %}</code> -&gt; <code>{% post_url some-post %}</code></li>
</ul>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="incremental-serving">Incremental Serving</h2>

<p>The next logical step is to only re-render what has actually changed.
This reduced reload times from <strong>12s to 3s</strong> 🎉🥳</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental

# or:
bundle exec jekyll serve -I
</code></pre>

<h3 id="caveat">Caveat</h3>

<p>The <code>--incremental</code> will only update file(s) that have actually changed.
This means that a new post will not appear in your blog post listing /
home page because <strong>that</strong> file has not changed…</p>

<p>To force an update:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">touch blog/index.html
</code></pre>

<p>Which works on my Windows system because of this function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">function touch($file) {
	if (Test-Path $file) {
		(Get-ChildItem $file).LastWriteTime = Get-Date
	} else {
		$Utf8NoBomEncoding = New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $False
		$path = Get-Location
		$path = Join-Path -Path $path -ChildPath $file
		[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, "", $Utf8NoBomEncoding)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>For pages like that, you can automate this by adding to the front matter:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">regenerate: true
</code></pre>

<h3 id="windows-directory-monitor">Windows Directory Monitor</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">
    <a href="https://github.com/Maher4Ever/wdm" style="margin-right: 6px">
        <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Maher4Ever/wdm.svg?style=social&amp;label=Star" style="vertical-align: middle" />
    </a>
    <a href="https://github.com/Maher4Ever/wdm">Maher4Ever/wdm</a>:
        A threaded directories monitor for Windows.</p>

<p>For Windows, you also need to add <code>wdm</code> to the <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt"># Performance-booster for watching directories on Windows
gem "wdm", "~&gt; 0.2.0", :platforms =&gt; [:mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin]
</code></pre>

<p><code>bundle install</code> and you’re ready to go!</p>

<h2 id="development-configyml">Development config.yml</h2>

<p>This can be improved even further by not doing some plugin work
that is typically not necessary during development anyway.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --config _config_dev.yml
</code></pre>

<p>In the copied <code>_config_dev.yml</code> I removed all the gems in
<code>group :jekyll_plugins do</code>.</p>

<p>This however only reduced the reload time by 0.5s which wasn’t worth
it for me as I’d have to keep two config.ymls in sync.</p>

<h3 id="limit-posts">Limit Posts</h3>

<p>In the <code>_config_dev.yml</code>, you can specify to only render the last x posts.
This turned out to be not very useful because the profiler told me
that most time is spent on reading and not so much on the rendering
phase.</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml"># While this seems like a super great idea, this no longer makes
# it possible to use post_url to point to a post that is older..
limit_posts: 20
</code></pre>

<h2 id="profiling">Profiling</h2>

<p>If it’s still taking too long, you can use <code>--profile</code> to figure out
what’s going on.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">bundle exec jekyll serve --profile
</code></pre>

<h2 id="powershell-profile">PowerShell Profile</h2>

<p>I have these added to my <a href="/blog/dev-setup/powershell-profiles/">ps profile</a>,
because who wants to remember/write all the bundle exec etc etc 😀</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">function Start-Jekyll {
	bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
}
function Start-JekyllWithDrafts {
	bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --incremental
}
function Start-JekyllDev {
	bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --config _config_dev.yml
}
function Start-JekyllDevWithDrafts {
	bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --incremental --config _config_dev.yml
}

    <a href="https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML">ClosedXML/ClosedXML</a>:
        ClosedXML is a .NET library for reading, manipulating and writing Excel 2007+ (.xlsx, .xlsm) files.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">Install-Package ClosedXML
</code></pre>

<p>It basically provides a more intuitive and user-friendly interface compared to
the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK">OpenXML API</a> it’s built on top off. Hence the name ;)</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="mit-licensed">MIT Licensed</h3>

<p>I used to be a big fan of EPPlus but since it is no longer free,
this aims to be a pretty much 1 to 1 conversion of our EPPlus blog series.</p>

<p>If you’re migrating, AI is pretty good at converting EPPlus code to ClosedXML,
for most (simple) use cases, it just works!</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>Documentation is a bit in limbo. The <strong>Github wiki</strong> contains most examples but
they are not always up to date, as for some things the API has changed slightly.</p>

<p>The <strong>ReadTheDocs</strong> is the new documentation and while it does go into a lot more detail
for some particularities, it does not cover everything and has a lot less examples.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/closedxml/closedxml/wiki">Github Wiki</a>: Lots of example code here
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/closedxml/closedxml/wiki/Data-Validation">Validation</a>: <code>cell.DataValidation</code> ⮕ <code>cell.CreateDataValidation()</code></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/closedxml/closedxml/wiki/Styles-Alignment">Comments</a>: <code>cell.Comment</code> ⮕ <code>cell.CreateComment()</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.closedxml.io/en/latest/">Read the docs</a>: Newer documentation, more details but less examples</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also the <a href="https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML/tree/develop/ClosedXML.Examples"><code>ClosedXML.Examples</code></a> console project in the source code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">git clone https://github.com/closedxml/closedxml
cd closedxml
dotnet run --project ClosedXML.Examples --framework net8.0
</code></pre>

<p>This creates all the example Excels in <code>ClosedXML.Examples/bin/Debug/net8.0/Created</code>,
you can then compare the code with the actual output and go from there!</p>

<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h2>

<pre><code class="language-c#">using ClosedXML.Excel;

using var workbook = new XLWorkbook();
IXLWorksheet sheet = workbook.AddWorksheet("MySheet");

// Setting &amp; getting values
IXLCell firstCell = sheet.Cell(1, 1);
firstCell.Value = "will it work?";
sheet.Cell("A2").FormulaA1 = "CONCATENATE(A1,\" ... Of course it will!\")";
Assert.That(firstCell.GetString(), Is.EqualTo("will it work?"));

// Numbers
var moneyCell = sheet.Cell("A3");
moneyCell.Style.NumberFormat.Format = "$#,##0.00";
// Or use a predefined style
// See: https://github.com/closedxml/closedxml/wiki/NumberFormatId-Lookup-Table
moneyCell.Style.NumberFormat.NumberFormatId = (int)XLPredefinedFormat.Number.Precision2WithSeparator;
moneyCell.Value = 1500.25M;

// Easily write any Enumerable to a sheet
var data = new[]
{
  new { FunctionName = "CHAR", Description = "Returns the character specified by the code number" },
  new { FunctionName = "FIND", Description = "Finds one text value within another (case-sensitive)" },
};
sheet.Cell("A4").InsertTable(data, true);
sheet.Cell("A12").InsertData(data);

// Styling cells
var someCells = sheet.Cells("A1,A4:B4");
someCells.Style.Font.Bold = true;
someCells.Style.Font.SetFontColor(XLColor.Ivory);
Assert.That(XLColor.Ivory, Is.EqualTo(XLColor.FromColor(Color.Ivory)));
// XLColor also has static methods FromArgb, FromHtml, FromKnownColor etc
// See: https://github.com/closedxml/closedxml/wiki/ClosedXML-Predefined-Colors
someCells.Style.Fill.SetPatternType(XLFillPatternValues.Solid);
someCells.Style.Fill.BackgroundColor = XLColor.Navy;

// Full control over filtering
// See: https://docs.closedxml.io/en/latest/features/autofilter.html
int lastCol = sheet.ColumnsUsed().Last().ColumnNumber();
sheet.Range(1, 1, 1, lastCol).SetAutoFilter();

sheet.ColumnsUsed().AdjustToContents();
workbook.SaveAs("basicUsage.xslx");
</code></pre>

<h3 id="fluent-syntax">Fluent Syntax</h3>

<p>At first I didn’t quite understand why there were both properties and “setter functions”
for so many things. It is a bit overkill but it does allow the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">someRange.Style.Fill.BackgroundColor = XLColor.FromHtml("#F0F4FF");
someRange.Style.Border.RightBorder = XLBorderStyleValues.Thin;
someRange.Style.Border.RightBorderColor = XLColor.FromHtml("#D4D4D4");
</code></pre>

<p>To also be written like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">someRange.Style
  .Fill.SetBackgroundColor(XLColor.FromHtml("#F0F4FF"))
  .Border.SetRightBorder(XLBorderStyleValues.Thin)
  .Border.SetRightBorderColor(XLColor.FromHtml("#D4D4D4"));
</code></pre>

<p>Which does look better! 😃</p>

      <title>DDD Europe</title>
    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>Last month, I had the opportunity to attend <strong>DDD Europe 2025</strong> in the Queen Elisabeth Hall in Antwerp — a few inspiring days full of insights, ideas, and engaging discussions around Domain-Driven Design, software quality, and architecture. Here are some of my key takeaways:</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-talks">The Talks</h2>

<h3 id="charting-the-uncharted">Charting the Uncharted</h3>

<p>By <a href="https://2025.dddeurope.com/speakers/prem-chandrasekaran/">Prem Chandrasekaran</a><br />
A passionate talk about the complexity of defining Bounded Contexts and subdomains in DDD. While well delivered, it mostly reinforced existing knowledge for me.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="domain-experiments">Domain Experiments</h3>

<p>By <a href="https://2025.dddeurope.com/speakers/mike-wojtyna/">Mike Wojtyna</a><br />
Loved this practical take on using TDD as a tool to experiment with domain models safely — a great approach to avoid full rewrites when evolving your model.</p>

<h3 id="design-patterns-for-software-diagramming">Design Patterns for Software Diagramming</h3>

<p>By <a href="https://2025.dddeurope.com/speakers/jacqui-read/">Jacqui Read</a><br />
One of the more directly applicable sessions! Clear and actionable tips on visual communication and software diagramming. I’ll definitely adopt some of these patterns in my day-to-day work.</p>

<h3 id="improving-feature-flag-implementation">Improving Feature Flag Implementation</h3>

<p>By <a href="https://2025.dddeurope.com/speakers/dorra-bartaguiz/">Dorra Bartaguiz</a><br />
This one didn’t quite land for me — the core message around feature flags got a bit lost in the delivery.</p>

<h3 id="team-topologies--microservices">Team Topologies &amp; Microservices</h3>

<p>By <a href="https://2025.dddeurope.com/speakers/chris-richardson/">Chris Richardson</a><br />
A strong reminder that microservices only thrive when paired with the right organizational design. Chris made a compelling case for using Team Topologies patterns to shift toward vertically sliced teams and improve team alignment and delivery effectiveness.</p>

<h3 id="a-defence-of-technical-excellence">A Defence of Technical Excellence</h3>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 1rem;">
  <img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/ddd-europe-2025-chris-simon.jpg" style="border-radius: 50%;" />
  <div>
    By <a href="https://2025.dddeurope.com/speakers/chris-simon/">Chris Simon</a>
    <p>⭐ My personal highlight!</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Chris introduced an excellent tool for visualizing reinforcing and balancing feedback loops to explain why internal software quality should never be compromised. As someone who has often had to defend technical quality in the face of budget or time pressure, this session gave me new arguments and a better mental model for those crucial conversations.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-conventions-for-more-performant-models">Breaking Conventions for More Performant Models</h3>

<p>By <a href="https://2025.dddeurope.com/speakers/cyrille-martraire/">Cyrille Martraire</a><br />
Some interesting examples of when breaking conventions can better align your model with its bounded context — though the practical takeaways for my own work were limited.</p>

<h3 id="my-ai-learning-journey">My AI Learning Journey</h3>

<p>By <a href="https://2025.dddeurope.com/speakers/eric-evans/">Eric Evans</a><br />
A fascinating deep dive from Eric into the world of LLMs and how companies like Anthropic shape model behavior. Academic in nature, but full of insight into how these models really work under the hood.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, DDD Europe 2025 was a great mix of deep dives, practical tips, and renewed perspectives. Already looking forward to next year!</p>]]></block2>

<p>After writing some code to fetch and mold the data, I was ready to train
“my” AI, dubbed “PongRank” which was easy enough and all was good until
I added a small WebApi to automate future syncing, retraining and predictions.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="docker-training">Docker Training</h2>

<p>As, once deployed, training failed with:</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>System.DllNotFoundException</strong>: Unable to load shared library ‘lib_lightgbm’ or one of its dependencies. In order to help diagnose loading problems, consider using a tool like strace. If you’re using glibc, consider setting the LD_DEBUG environment variable:<br />
libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br />
/app/lib_lightgbm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</p>

<p>It’s a conscious decision by the team to not include LightGBM by default,
and that makes perfect sense since it is a 1gig dependency which is only
used when using that trainer.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="installing-lightgbm">Installing LightGBM</h2>

<p>A simple Google search got me to the LightGBM installation instructions:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM.git
cd LightGBM &amp;&amp; mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
cmake .. &amp;&amp; make -j &amp;&amp; make install
</code></pre>

<h3 id="cmake-detour">CMake Detour</h3>

<p>The <code>apt-get install cmake -y</code> installed version 3.25.1 which was just not
good enough for LightGBM!</p>

<p class="notice--danger">CMake 3.28 or higher is required.  You are running version 3.25.1</p>

<p>And now it was really starting to show that I’m very far from a Linux
installation/compilation hero. After trying to build CMake for a few
hours, I ended up installing <code>pip</code> to install CMake with.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">apt-get install python3-pip -y
pip install cmake --upgrade --break-system-packages

# Check version:
cmake --version
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--break-system-packages</code> obviously isn’t a very good sign but since
we will be doing this in the build step of our Dockerfile, it’s fine 😅</p>

<h2 id="final-dockerfile">Final Dockerfile</h2>

<pre><code class="language-sh">FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install git clang-3.9 libunwind8 curl libomp-dev -y

RUN apt-get install python3-pip -y
RUN pip install cmake --upgrade --break-system-packages

RUN git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM.git
RUN cd LightGBM &amp;&amp; mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build &amp;&amp; cmake .. &amp;&amp; make -j &amp;&amp; make install

# Usual steps for building the .NET app
# dotnet restore/publish etc

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 as runtime

COPY --from=build /app /app
COPY --from=build /usr/local/lib/lib_lightgbm.so /usr/local/lib/lib_lightgbm.so
COPY --from=build /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1

ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "/app/WebApi.dll" ]
</code></pre>

<p>I figured out which files needed to be copied with the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh"># Enter running container
# (with lightgbm installed)
docker exec -it lightgbm bash

# Find location
find / -name 'lib_lightgbm.so' 2&gt;/dev/null

# List dynamic dependencies
ldd /usr/local/lib/lib_lightgbm.so
</code></pre>

<p>And there we have it, a WebApi that creates the models!</p>]]></block2>

<p>The git repository has been archived since January 2025 and they basically point you towards
<a href="https://www.triplechecker.com/">www.triplechecker.com</a> which is their cloud deploy.</p>

<p>It worked very well… Finding a whopping 100 spelling errors on itenium.be,
but after the first 7 errors, it asked me to sign up for a mere €15/month. Uhm, no thanks.</p>]]></block1>

<p>You can pretty easily host it yourself though!</p>

cd siteinspector
# Open docker-compose.yml, search for "SECRET_KEY_BASE:"

<p>So one of the 100+ typos it found was on our home page,

<h2 id="let-ai-figure-it-out">Let AI figure it out</h2>

<p>Since the siteinspector README just points you towards the paying service,
I had the brilliant idea of asking AI to figure it out for me!</p>

<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: <em>https://github.com/siteinspector/siteinspector</em><br />
<em>You know this one? Know how I can run it against my website?</em></p>

<p class="notice--info">Yes! <code>siteinspector</code> is a Ruby gem that audits websites for things like redirects, headers, security, and more.</p>

<p>Here’s how to run it against your website:</p>

<p>✅ 1. Install Ruby (if needed)<br />
✅ 2. Install siteinspector gem<br />
✅ 3. Run it against your site</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">gem install siteinspector
siteinspector https://itenium.be

<h3 id="ai-slopsquatting">AI Slopsquatting</h3>

<pre><code>ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'siteinspector' (&gt;= 0) in any repository
ERROR:  Possible alternatives: site-inspector

<p>That’s right, the gem doesn’t exist. And <code>site-inspector</code> is something different.</p>

Let’s use the same steps mechanism it used on me to run a potentially disastrous command to illustrate.</p>

<p>✅ 1. AI hallucinates some dependency that looks real.<br />

<p>System.Text.Json (STJ) is about twice as fast as Newtonsoft.Json while only consuming 50% as much memory.
A legacy project might still be using Newtonsoft but chances are serialization
isn’t a bottleneck so it’s probably not worth making the switch.</p>

<p>For new applications you’ll want to stick with STJ however. Only add the extra nuget
if you really need one of the advanced Newtonsoft features (ex: Linq to Json, polymorphic
serialization, circular reference handling).</p>]]></excerpt>

<h3 id="floats">Floats</h3>

<p>Serialize float/double NaN, Infinity and -Infinity as strings.</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">// System.Text.Json
var opts = new JsonSerializerOptions()
{
  NumberHandling = JsonNumberHandling.AllowNamedFloatingPointLiterals,
  // JsonNumberHandling.Strict (default): Throw ArgumentException for NaN etc
};
var obj = new Floats() { Float = 3.1415f, Float2 = float.NaN };
string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(obj, opts);
Assert.Equal("{\"Float\":3.1415,\"Float2\":\"NaN\"}", json);

// Serialize all values as strings
opts = new JsonSerializerOptions()
{
  NumberHandling = JsonNumberHandling.WriteAsString | JsonNumberHandling.AllowReadingFromString
};
obj = new Floats() { Float = 3.1415f, Float2 = float.PositiveInfinity};
json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(obj, opts);
Assert.Equal("{\"Float\":\"3.1415\",\"Float2\":\"Infinity\"}", json);


// Newtonsoft.Json
var sets = new JsonSerializerSettings()
{
  // "String" is the default behavior:
  FloatFormatHandling = FloatFormatHandling.String,
  // FloatFormatHandling.DefaultValue: Serialize NaN etc as 0.0
  // FloatFormatHandling.Symbol: Serialize NaN etc WITHOUT quotes (=not valid json)
};
var obj = new Floats() { Float = 3.1415f, Float2 = float.NegativeInfinity };
string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj, sets);
Assert.Equal("{\"Float\":3.1415,\"Float2\":\"-Infinity\"}", json);

// Newtonsoft can also serialize ALL floats as a string with a custom converter
var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings
{
  Converters = new List&lt;JsonConverter&gt; { new StringFloatConverter() },
};

public class StringFloatConverter : JsonConverter
{
  public override bool CanConvert(Type objectType) =&gt; objectType == typeof(float);

  public override object ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objType, object value, JsonSerializer serializer)
  {
    if (reader.TokenType == JsonToken.String)
      return float.Parse((string)reader.Value);

    return Convert.ToDouble(reader.Value);
  }

  public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, object value, JsonSerializer serializer)
  {
    writer.WriteValue(((float)value).ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="default-options">Default Options</h3>

<p>Only for Newtonsoft:</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">JsonConvert.DefaultSettings = () =&gt; new JsonSerializerSettings {};

// Read-only for STJ:
var defaultOpts = JsonSerializerOptions.Default;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<h3 id="case-sensitivity">Case Sensitivity</h3>

<p>One of the reasons System.Text.Json is so much more performant is because
Newtonsoft json key names are completely case insensitive, while property
name cases have to match exactly in STJ.</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">public record Person(string Name);

// System.Text.Json
string json = "{\"name\":\"Bert\"}";
var obj = JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;Person&gt;(json);
Assert.Null(obj.Name);

// Newtonsoft.Json
string json = "{\"name\":\"Bert\"}";
var obj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;Person&gt;(json);
Assert.Equal("Bert", obj.Name);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="postels-law">Postel’s law</h3>

<p class="notice--info">Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept.</p>

<p>Newtonsoft.Json is <strong>very</strong> liberal in what it will deserialize
for you without complaint.</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">string json = """
{
  // Newtonsoft parses this
  Name: 'Bert',
}
""";
</code></pre>

<p>While System.Text.Json throws a <code>JsonException</code> on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The comment</li>
  <li>The missing quotes around Name</li>
  <li>The use of single quotes around Bert</li>
  <li>The extra comma after ‘Bert’</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these can still be parsed by STJ with some extra configuration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">var opts = new JsonSerializerOptions()
{
  PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,
  ReadCommentHandling = JsonCommentHandling.Skip,
  AllowTrailingCommas = true,
};
</code></pre>

<h3 id="spanof-t">Span(Of T)</h3>

<p>The main reason for the performance difference however is the use of <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code>
in System.Text.Json. Which is not being adopted by Newtonsoft because of
.NET Framework support.</p>

<p>Performance is about 2x but this increases to about 3x for serialization when
using the STJ <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/">source generation</a>
feature to eliminate the use of Reflection.</p>

<h2 id="webapi">WebApi</h2>

<p>System.Text.Json is the default from .NET Core 3.1 and up.</p>

<p>I’ve added the same “sensible” configuration for both:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use camelCase for property names – which is typically used in JavaScript</li>
  <li>During development, pretty print the json</li>
  <li>Do not include <code>null</code> and primitive default values (ex: <code>false</code>, <code>0</code>) in the output so the bytes sent over the network are somewhat reduced</li>
  <li>Serialize enums as strings. While this increases the bytes sent, it does make them more human-readable.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// System.Text.Json
builder.Services.AddControllers().AddJsonOptions(options =&gt;
{
  options.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase;

  if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
    options.JsonSerializerOptions.WriteIndented = true;

  options.JsonSerializerOptions.DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingDefault;
  options.JsonSerializerOptions.Converters.Add(new JsonStringEnumConverter());
});

// System.Text.Json for Minimal APIs (.NET Core 7)
builder.Services.ConfigureHttpJsonOptions(options =&gt; { ... });
// If not specified, defaults to:
var opts = new JsonSerializerOptions(JsonSerializerDefaults.Web);
Assert.True(opts.PropertyNameCaseInsensitive);
Assert.Equal(JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase, opts.PropertyNamingPolicy);
Assert.Equal(JsonNumberHandling.AllowReadingFromString, opts.NumberHandling);


// Newtonsoft.Json
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson

using Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization;
builder.Services.AddControllers().AddNewtonsoftJson(options =&gt;
{
  options.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver();

  if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
    options.SerializerSettings.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;

  options.SerializerSettings.NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore;
  options.SerializerSettings.DefaultValueHandling = DefaultValueHandling.Ignore;
  options.SerializerSettings.Converters.Add(new Newtonsoft.Json.Converters.StringEnumConverter());
});
</code></pre>

<h2 id="custom-converters">Custom Converters</h2>

<p>When the serialization options/settings can’t handle your case, maybe because
you cannot control how the json communication happens or because some values
should be converted to a domain specific type, you can add your own converters.</p>

<p>Imagine that our frontend sends and/or accepts Money in a specific culture, like
<code>15.000,99</code> (nl-BE formatting).</p>

<h3 id="stj-culturalmoney">STJ CulturalMoney</h3>

<p>For illustration purposes only; you’ll probably want to handle all sorts of edge cases 😉</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">new JsonSerializerOptions().Converters.Add(new CulturalMoneyConverter(new CultureInfo("nl-BE")));

public class CulturalMoneyConverter(CultureInfo culture) : JsonConverter&lt;decimal&gt;
{
  public override decimal Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type toConvert, JsonSerializerOptions opts)
  {
    return reader.TokenType == JsonTokenType.String
      ? decimal.Parse(reader.GetString(), NumberStyles.Any, culture)
      : reader.GetDecimal();
  }

  public override void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, decimal value, JsonSerializerOptions options)
  {
    writer.WriteStringValue(value.ToString("#,###.##", culture));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="newtonsoft-culturalmoney">Newtonsoft CulturalMoney</h3>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">new JsonSerializerSettings().Converters.Add(new CulturalMoneyConverter(new CultureInfo("nl-BE")));

public class CulturalMoneyConverter(CultureInfo culture) : Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConverter
{
  public override bool CanConvert(Type objectType) =&gt; objectType == typeof(decimal);

  public override object ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objType, object? value, JsonSerializer js)
  {
    return reader.TokenType == JsonToken.String
      ? decimal.Parse((string)reader.Value, NumberStyles.Any, culture)
      : Convert.ToDecimal(reader.Value);
  }

  public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, object? value, JsonSerializer serializer)
  {
    writer.WriteValue(((decimal)value).ToString("#,###.##", culture));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="contract-resolvers">Contract Resolvers</h3>

<p>If converters aren’t doing it for you, because your frontend team is sending some
really weird stuff, it’s still possible to further alter the behavior of serialization.</p>

<p>In STJ this is done by setting the <code>JsonSerializerOptions.TypeInfoResolver</code>, where you
could use <code>new DefaultJsonTypeInfoResolver()</code> and set the <code>Modifiers</code> property or provide
custom implementation(s) with <code>JsonTypeInfoResolver.Combine(...)</code>.</p>

<p>For Newtonsoft, set the <code>JsonSerializerSettings.ContractResolver</code> and inherit from
the <code>DefaultContractResolver</code>.</p>

<h2 id="adoption">Adoption</h2>

<p><a href="https://nugettrends.com/packages?ids=System.Text.Json&amp;ids=Newtonsoft.Json&amp;months=120">Adoption for both libraries is going up</a>, with no decline in sight for Newtonsoft.Json
but I’m guessing this is comparing apples and oranges because STJ is included by default
and is thus under-represented in the graph.</p>

<h2 id="more">More!!</h2>

<h3 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3>

<p>Works pretty much out of the box for Newtonsoft.
For STJ it is possible to achieve starting from .NET Core 7
with the <code>JsonDerivedTypeAttribute</code> on the base class.</p>

<h3 id="attributes">Attributes</h3>

<p>Both have attributes that can be applied to fields and/or
properties to change serialization behavior without reverting
to custom code.</p>

<h4 id="stj-attributes">STJ Attributes</h4>

<p>Of course I have written this test many times before. These days it can be quickly

      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>

<p>Maybe you want to remove the code allowing <code>[AllowAnonymous]</code> or something…</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-controllers">Finding the Controllers</h3>

<p>The code above checks for the presence of <code>[ApiController]</code> but your mileage may vary:</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">// Controllers have [ApiController] attribute
.Where(t =&gt; t.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(ApiControllerAttribute), true).Any())

// Controllers inherit from ControllerBase
.Where(t =&gt; t.IsSubclassOf(typeof(ControllerBase)))

// Check for "Controller" in the name (or use EndsWith)
.Where(t =&gt; t.Name.Contains("Controller"))
</code></pre>

<h3 id="notimplementedexception">NotImplementedException</h3>

<p>In a blatant violation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle">Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</a>
some of our controllers implemented an interface but only implemented a few of the methods, with all others just doing a:</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">throw new NotImplementedException();
</code></pre>

<p>And of course this broke the test 🙈</p>

<p>More AI to the rescue! Thank god for AI too, because I’m pretty sure
I would’ve spent a lot of time on this otherwise 🔥</p>

<p>This doesn’t catch all variations (ex: <code>var ex = new NotImplementedException(); throw ex;</code>)
but was good enough for our code-base.</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">public static bool MethodThrowsNotImplementedException(MethodInfo method)
{
  byte[]? methodBody = method.GetMethodBody()?.GetILAsByteArray();
  if (methodBody == null)

        return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

<h2 id="minimal-apis">Minimal APIs</h2>

<p>We’re not using minimal APIs but for the sake of completeness, here is the code
to check the same thing:</p>

<h3 id="programcs">Program.cs</h3>

<p>Here we need to check if either <code>RequireAuthorization</code> or <code>AllowAnonymous</code> fluent
methods were called for each endpoint.</p>

<p>Also note the <code>public partial class Program</code> addition so that we can reference Program
from the test. This is probably not necessary if you have nicely split your startup code
instead of just dumping everything in Program.cs 😉</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">app.MapGet("/unsecured", () =&gt; "Stormy");
app.MapGet("/secured", () =&gt; "Sunny").RequireAuthorization();
app.MapGet("/anonymous", () =&gt; "Cloudy").AllowAnonymous();

        Create memoized 'selector' functions</p>

<p>One of the Redux Style Guide “Strongly Recommended” rules is
<a href="https://redux.js.org/style-guide/#keep-state-minimal-and-derive-additional-values">Keep State Minimal and Derive Additional Values</a>:</p>

<p class="notice--info">Keep the actual data in the Redux store as minimal as possible, and derive additional values from that state as needed.</p>

<p>Another strongly recommended rule is
<a href="https://redux.js.org/style-guide/#normalize-complex-nestedrelational-state">Normalize Complex Nested/Relational State</a></p>

<p class="notice--info">Many applications need to cache complex data in the store. That data is often received in a nested form from an API,
or has relations between different entities in the data (such as a blog that contains Users, Posts, and Comments).</p>

<p>Of course your components are interested in those derived values and in the nested data. Keeping those calculations
and recombining the data efficient is where <code>createSelector</code> comes into play.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>By convention, selectors are named <a href="https://redux.js.org/style-guide/#name-selector-functions-as-selectthing"><code>selectThing</code></a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>inputSelectors</code>: The first argument, the dependencies, is an array of root state selectors</li>
  <li><code>combiner</code>: The second argument, the result function, calculates the derived state</li>
  <li><code>createSelectorOptions</code>: The third (optional) options argument configures how the selector behaves</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { createSelector } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const selectMyTodosCompletedCount = createSelector(
  [
    (state: RootState) =&gt; state.todos,
    (state: RootState) =&gt; state.user.id,
  ],
  (todos, userId) =&gt; {
    return todos.filter(todo =&gt; todo.userId === userId &amp;&amp; todo.done).length;
  }
)


// Usage in a component
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

const TodosDoneCount = () =&gt; {
  const doneCount = useSelector(selectMyTodosCompletedCount);
  return &lt;&gt;✔️ {doneCount}&lt;/&gt;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Every time the root state changes, it will execute the inputSelectors; in this case
<code>state.todos</code> and <code>state.user.id</code>. If the returned references have not changed, the memoized
count is returned, otherwise the combiner is executed.</p>

<p>This is also why you want to select the todos and the userId separately, if you select them
as <code>({todos: state.todos, userId: state.user.id})</code>, you’d get a new reference every time,
effectively rendering the selector useless!</p>

<p>The Reselect development-only <a href="https://reselect.js.org/api/development-only-stability-checks#inputstabilitycheck"><code>inputStabilityCheck</code></a>
executes the selector twice and logs a warning to the console
if one of the inputSelectors returns a different reference.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="with-parameters">With Parameters</h3>

<p>Filter the todo list with a needle parameter.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">const selectTodos = createSelector(
  [
    (state: RootState) =&gt; state.todos,
    (_, needle: string) =&gt; needle,
  ],
  (todos, needle) =&gt; todos.filter(todo =&gt; todo.text.includes(needle))
)

// Usage in a component
const TodoList = ({searchNeedle}) =&gt; {
  const todos = useSelector(state =&gt; selectTodos(state, searchNeedle));
  return todos.map(todo =&gt; (
    &lt;Todo key={todo.id} todo={todo} /&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you don’t like this syntax, see the <a href="https://reselect.js.org/FAQ#how-can-i-make-a-curried-selector">Reselect FAQ</a>
on how to create a curried selector instead.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// This would allow you to do this instead:
const todos = useSelector(selectTodos(searchNeedle));

// The FAQ also contains a recipe to turn this into:
const todos = useSelectTodos(searchNeedle);
</code></pre>

<h4 id="multiple-parameters">Multiple Parameters</h4>

<pre><code class="language-ts">const selectTodos = createSelector(
  [
    (state: RootState) =&gt; state.todos,
    (_, needle: string) =&gt; needle,
    (_, __, caseSensitive: boolean) =&gt; caseSensitive
  ],
  (todos, needle, caseSensitive) =&gt; { /* magic here */ }
)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="createselectoroptions">createSelectorOptions</h3>

<p>Reselect will only execute the combiner fn when the inputs have changed,
which is typically your entire root state (with potentially additional parameters)
AND the result of those input selectors has changed.</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/reduxjs-toolkit-reselect-how-it-works.png" alt="How reselect works" title="How reselect works" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Configure this behavior with <code>argsMemoize(Options)</code> and <code>memoize(Options)</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to change the default behavior of many/all
selectors, use <a href="https://reselect.js.org/api/createSelectorCreator">createSelectorCreator</a>.</p>

<h4 id="lrumemoize">lruMemoize</h4>

<p><a href="https://reselect.js.org/api/lruMemoize"><code>lruMemoize</code></a>
(Least Recently Used) was the default before v5 of Reselect.
It had a default cache size of 1, meaning a recomputation every time
one of the inputSelectors changed.</p>

<p>The “problem” with lruMemoize was that a cache of size 1 might
not be that useful! This was typically solved with <code>useMemo</code>
or by passing <code>memoizeOptions: { maxSize: 5 }</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { lruMemoize } from "reselect";
import { shallowEqual } from "react-redux";

export const selectMyTodosCompletedCount = createSelector(
  [(state: RootState) =&gt; ({todos: state.todos, userId: state.more.users.ids[0]})],
  ({todos, userId}) =&gt;  todos.filter(todo =&gt; todo.userId === userId &amp;&amp; todo.done).length,
  {
    memoize: lruMemoize,
    memoizeOptions: {
      equalityCheck: (a, b) =&gt; a.todos === b.todos &amp;&amp; a.userId === b.userId,
      // resultEqualityCheck: shallowEqual,
      // maxSize: 10
    },
    // argsMemoize: lruMemoize,
    // argsMemoizeOptions: {
    //   equalityCheck: shallowEqual,
    //   resultEqualityCheck: shallowEqual,
    //   maxSize: 10
    // }
  }
)
</code></pre>

<h4 id="weakmapmemoize-default">weakMapMemoize (default)</h4>

<p><a href="https://reselect.js.org/api/weakMapMemoize"><code>weakMapMemoize</code></a>
is the new default since v5 and provides a dynamic cache size
out of the box.</p>

<h4 id="unstable_autotrackmemoize-experimental">unstable_autotrackMemoize (experimental)</h4>

<p>There is also the experimental <a href="https://reselect.js.org/api/unstable_autotrackMemoize"><code>unstable_autotrackMemoize</code></a>,
which, like <code>proxy-memoize</code> below, can be more efficient.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { unstable_autotrackMemoize } from "reselect";

// The combiner (todos.filter) will NOT execute when we
// toggle a Todo between done/not done as that field is
// not accessed.
const selectTodos = createSelector(
  [
    (state: RootState) =&gt; state.todos,
    (_, needle: string) =&gt; needle,
  ],
  (todos, needle) =&gt; todos.filter(todo =&gt; todo.text.includes(needle)),
  {
    memoize: unstable_autotrackMemoize,
  }
)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="createslice">createSlice</h2>

<p>Common selectors can already be defined in the <code>createSlice</code> setup.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">const todoSlice = createSlice({
  initialState: [],

  // Predefined selectors, which receive the slice's state as their first parameter.
  selectors: {
    selectTodo: (state, id: number): Todo | undefined =&gt; {
      return state.find(todo =&gt; todo.id === id);
    },
  },
});

export const { selectTodo } = todoSlice.selectors;

// Usage in a component
const todo = useSelector(state =&gt; selectTodo(state, todoId));
</code></pre>

<h2 id="typescript">TypeScript</h2>

<p>See <a href="/blog/javascript/reduxjs-toolkit-typescript/">ReduxJS/Toolkit: TypeScript</a>
if you’re unsure how to create the <code>RootState</code>.</p>

        Intuitive magical memoization library with Proxy and WeakMap</p>

<p>This will re-execute when the <code>done</code> property toggles even though
it has no impact on the actual result.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { createSelector } from "reselect";

const selectTodoDescriptionsReselect = createSelector(
  [state =&gt; state.todos],
  todos =&gt; todos.map(todo =&gt; todo.text)

<p>With <code>proxy-memoize</code>, this would not be the case as due to the proxy,
it figures only text is actually relevant for selector.</p>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p><code>createAsyncThunk</code> generates promise lifecycle action types, which you
handle in the <code>extraReducers</code> of your slice.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const fetchStuff = createAsyncThunk(
  'resource/action',
  async (params, thunkApi) =&gt; {
    try {

    } catch {
      // Also possible to return a rejected Promise
      return thunkApi.rejectWithValue("Well, that failed");
    }
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>This dispatches the following actions (from the first “Type” argument):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>resource/action/pending</code>: display a spinner or something?</li>
  <li><code>resource/action/rejected</code>: display an error message?</li>
  <li><code>resource/action/fulfilled</code>: while the previous two could be considered optional, you definitely want to handle this one!</li>
</ul>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>Check <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk#promise-lifecycle-actions">Promise Lifecycle Actions</a>

      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>

<pre><code class="language-ts">createAsyncThunk(Type, PayloadCreator, [Options]);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="1-type">1. Type</h3>

<p>A string that will be prepended with the three states and dispatched as they happen.</p>

<h3 id="2-payloadcreator">2. PayloadCreator</h3>

<pre><code class="language-ts">async (params, thunkApi) =&gt; {}
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li><code>params</code>: What you’ll call the thunk with. This could be the request body, an id, queryString variables etc</li>
  <li><code>thunkApi</code>: An object containing
    <ul>
      <li><code>dispatch</code>: To dispatch actions other than the three that are generated</li>
      <li><code>getState</code>: Gets the current root store state</li>
      <li><code>extra</code>: The argument passed to <code>configureStore({middleware: getDefaultMiddleware =&gt; getDefaultMiddleware({thunk: {extraArgument: "**this**"}})})</code></li>
      <li><code>requestId</code>: unique generated ID</li>
      <li><code>signal</code>: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/signal">AbortController.signal</a> when you want to implement cancellation (see <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk#cancellation">Cancellation</a>)</li>
      <li><code>rejectWithValue(value; [meta])</code> and <code>fulfillWithValue(value, [meta])</code>: or just throw/return!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-options">3. Options</h3>

<p>An option object that can contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>condition</code>: if this function returns false, no actions will be dispatched, see <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk#canceling-before-execution">Canceling before execution</a>
    <ul>
      <li><code>dispatchConditionRejection</code>: if <code>condition</code> returned false and this field is true, the rejected action will still be dispatched</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>idGenerator</code>: Uses <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/other-exports#nanoid">nanoid</a> by default</li>
  <li><code>serializeError</code>: Serialize errors in a different way than <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/serialize-error">sindresorhus/serialize-error</a></li>
  <li><code>getPendingMeta</code>: merge extra data into <code>pendingAction.meta</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unwrapping">Unwrapping</h2>

<p><code>createAsyncThunk</code> always returns a resolved promise, even if it was rejected.
To get the actual contents, <code>.unwrap()</code> it!</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">dispatch(fetchStuff({id: 42}))
  .unwrap()
  .then(success =&gt; {})
  .catch(error =&gt; {})
</code></pre>

<h2 id="matchers">Matchers</h2>

<p>We already saw the <code>fetchStuff.settled</code> (for handling fulfilled or rejected) matcher above but there
are <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/matching-utilities#createasyncthunk-specific-matchers">other ways</a>
to handle multiple actions with a single matcher.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { isPending } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

type GenericAsyncThunk = AsyncThunk&lt;unknown, unknown, any&gt;
type PendingAction = ReturnType&lt;GenericAsyncThunk['pending']&gt;
type RejectedAction = ReturnType&lt;GenericAsyncThunk['rejected']&gt;
type FulfilledAction = ReturnType&lt;GenericAsyncThunk['fulfilled']&gt;

const mySlice = createSlice({
  extraReducers: builder =&gt; {
    builder.addMatcher&lt;RejectedAction&gt;(
      action =&gt; action.type.endsWith('/rejected'),
      (state, action) =&gt; {
        state.status = 'failed';
      }
    );

    builder.addMatcher(isPending, (state, action) =&gt; {
      // Or by using the existing isPending matcher utility
      // Other utilities: isAllOf, isAnyOf
      // isAsyncThunkAction, isFulfilled, isRejected(WithValue)
    });

    builder.addDefaultCase((state, action) =&gt; {
      // Handle everything that was not previously handled
      // Contrast to addMatcher which may handle an action
      // that was already handled by other case / matchers
    });
  }
});
</code></pre>

<h2 id="reducer-creator">Reducer Creator</h2>

<p>This alternative <code>reducers</code> creation allows you to add thunks
without having to revert to <code>extraReducers</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { buildCreateSlice, asyncThunkCreator } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

// Extra setup required for adding thunks to reducers
const createAppSlice = buildCreateSlice({
  creators: { asyncThunk: asyncThunkCreator },
});

const creatorSlice = createAppSlice({
  initialState: [],
  reducers: create =&gt; ({
    deleteEntity: create.reducer&lt;{id: number}&gt;((state, action) =&gt; {
      return state.filter(x =&gt; x.id !== action.payload);
    }),

    addPartial: create.preparedReducer(
      (todo: Partial&lt;Todo&gt;) =&gt; {
        return {
          payload: {
            text: 'Default Text',
            ...todo,
          }
        }
      },
      (state, action) =&gt; {
        state.push(action.payload);
      }
    ),

    // See above, requires buildCreateSlice()
    getCreatures: create.asyncThunk(
      async (params, thunkApi): Promise&lt;MyEntity&gt; =&gt; {
        const res = await fetch(`/api/resource/${params.id}`);
        return res.json();
      }, {
        pending: state =&gt; {
          console.log('Getting entity');
        },
        rejected: (state, action) =&gt; {
          console.log('Failed getting entity');
        },
        fulfilled: (state, action) =&gt; {

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>The legacy Redux <code>createStore</code> could make a grown man cry, and probably has.
<code>createSlice</code> and <code>configureStore</code> GREATLY simplifies this process while at the same
time also significantly reducing the boilerplate – you can basically delete
all your actions as they are now defined by the reducers!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>createSlice</code>: each top level object of your state is typically a slice</li>
  <li><code>configureStore</code>: abstracts away the horror that was <code>createStore</code></li>

  name: "todos",
  initialState: [] as Todo[],
  reducers: {
    // A default reducer:
    // The actions are exported from the reducers (below)
    removeTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;number&gt;) =&gt; {
      return state.filter(todo =&gt; todo.id !== action.payload);
    },

    // A prepared reducer
    // When you need to modify the payload before handling
    addTodo: {
      reducer: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;Todo&gt;) =&gt; {
        state.push(action.payload);
      },
      prepare: (todo: Partial&lt;Todo&gt;) =&gt; {
        // The addTodo action takes a Partial&lt;Todo&gt;
        // But the reducer handles a complete Todo.

      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="dispatching-an-action">Dispatching an action</h3>

<p>See <a href="/blog/javascript/reduxjs-toolkit-typescript/">Part 5: TypeScript</a>
for how to create the <code>useAppDispatch</code> hook.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { addTodo } from "./todoSlice";

const TodoAdd = () =&gt; {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
  const [todo, setTodo] = useState&lt;Todo&gt;({});
  return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch(addTodo(todo))}&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="configurestore">configureStore</h2>

<p>Once you’ve defined some slices, time to combine them into your store.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// Create the store
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    todos: todoSlice.reducer,
    user: userSlice.reducer,
  },

  // DevTools extension is added by default
  // Here we disable it for production:
  devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',

  // Optionally hydrate the store from somewhere:
  preloadedState: localStorage.getItem('redux'),
});


// Bind it to our main &lt;App /&gt; component
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

const root = createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);
root.render(
  &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;
    &lt;App /&gt;
  &lt;/Provider&gt;
);
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a store with “RootState”:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">type RootState = {
  todos: ReturnType&lt;typeof todoSlice.getInitialState&gt;;
  user: ReturnType&lt;typeof userSlice.getInitialState&gt;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It really doesn’t get any easier than that. Without overriding

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk">redux-thunk</a> middleware is added by default,

  <li><a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/actionCreatorMiddleware">ActionCreatorInvariantMiddleware</a>: detects if an action creator has been dispatched (an action creator should’ve been called before being dispatched)</li>

check out the <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/matching-utilities">matching utilities</a> provided by the toolkit.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createListenerMiddleware">Listener middleware</a> is what ReduxJS/Toolkit

<h3 id="enhancers">Enhancers</h3>

<p>Middleware is added to the store by the <a href="https://redux.js.org/api/applymiddleware"><code>applyMiddleware</code></a>

you’re going to be writing any yourself.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">const store = configureStore({
  enhancers: getDefaultEnhancers =&gt; getDefaultEnhancers().concat(...),

      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="redux-bugs">Redux Bugs</h2>

<p>Redux bugs are almost always cases where you didn’t quite spread enough and/or did
an accidental mutation of the state.</p>

<p>This is exactly the problem immer addresses and does so in a way that you basically
don’t know you’re using immer until you inspect the type and see <code>WritableDraft&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<h3 id="without-immer">Without Immer</h3>

<p>Do you really want to be doing this…</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">function reducerSpreadHell(state, action) {
  return {
    ...state,
    first: {
      ...state.first,
      second: {
        ...state.first.second,
        [action.someId]: {
          ...state.first.second[action.someId],
          fourth: action.someValue,
        },
      },
    },
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One could argue that you should be normalizing your store instead of
writing reducers like that, and you’d be right.</p>

<h3 id="with-immer">With Immer</h3>

<p>Still, with immer, all that becomes just this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">state.first.second[action.someId].fourth = action.someValue;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="immer-reducers">Immer Reducers</h2>

<p>You’d write them as if you just didn’t care about immutability!</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { current, PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

reducers: {
  addTodo: (state: WritableDraft&lt;Todo&gt;[], action: PayloadAction&lt;Todo&gt;) =&gt; {
    // ReduxJS/Toolkit wraps the Todo[] state in a WritableDraft
    // "[].push()" does NOT mutate!
    // Same for pop, shift, splice etc...
    state.push(action.payload);
  },

  removeTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;number&gt;) =&gt; {
    // ATTN: state = newState does NOT work!
    // In such case, return the newState
    return state.filter(todo =&gt; todo.id !== action.payload);
  },

  // ATTN: Mutate or Return, but not both!
  altAddTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;Todo&gt;) =&gt; void state.push(action.payload),

  toggleTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;number&gt;) =&gt; {
    // If you want to look at the current state, you need to use current()
    // There is also original()
    console.log('current(state)', current(state));

    const todo = state.find(todo =&gt; todo.id === action.payload)!;
    todo.done = !todo.done;
  },

  updateTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;Todo&gt;) =&gt; {
    const index = state.findIndex(todo =&gt; todo.id === action.payload.id);
    if (index !== -1) {
      state[index] = action.payload;
    }
  },
},
</code></pre>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>There are some caveats like using <code>current()</code> when you want to look at the state.</p>

<h4 id="replacing-the-entire-state">Replacing the entire state</h4>

<p>As in the case of removeTodo, you cannot completely replace <code>state</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// ⚠️⚠️ DOES NOT WORK ⚠️⚠️
removeTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;number&gt;) =&gt; {
  // This could only work if state would be "by ref"
  // which JavaScript doesn't have
  state = state.filter(todo =&gt; todo.id !== action.payload);
}

// ✔️✔️ DOES WORK ✔️✔️
removeTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;number&gt;) =&gt; {
  return state.filter(todo =&gt; todo.id !== action.payload);
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="reducers-without-curly-braces">Reducers without curly braces</h4>

<p>Use <code>void</code> for your one-liner reducers:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// ⚠️⚠️ TypeScript ERROR ⚠️⚠️
// [].push() returns a number which is not a valid new state
addTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;Todo&gt;) =&gt; state.push(action.payload)

// ✔️✔️ BOTH WORK ✔️✔️
addTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;Todo&gt;) =&gt; void state.push(action.payload)
addTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;Todo&gt;) =&gt; {
  state.push(action.payload);
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="primitives-cannot-be-wrapped">Primitives cannot be wrapped</h4>

<p>If you extract a primitive value (number, bool, string) from the state
and then manipulate it, you’re no longer working with a WritableDraft
and are just mutating the local variable.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">addMessage: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;any&gt;) =&gt; {
  // ⚠️⚠️ DOES NOT WORK ⚠️⚠️
  let { newMessagesCount } = state;
  newMessagesCount++;

  // ✔️✔️ DOES WORK ✔️✔️
  state.newMessagesCount++;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2>

<p>Immer’s bread and butter is the <code>produce(baseState, recipe)</code> function.
It takes your <code>baseState</code>, wraps it in a <code>WritableDraft</code> and
executes a <code>recipe</code> against it, which means calling your reducer
with the dispatched action. It then creates the new state
by re-applying the steps done in the recipe to the baseState,
but in a non-mutating way.</p>

<p>The ReduxJS/Toolkit reducers have already called <code>produce</code>,
so this has been abstracted away for us.</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/reduxjs-toolkit-immer-flow.png" alt="The immer flow" title="The immer flow" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h3 id="produce-example">Produce Example</h3>

<p>Small code example to illustrate how <code>produce</code> works.
In the accompanying git repository, the code is a bit more involved and includes tests
to prove that only the objects that changed actually have
different references!</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { produce } from "immer";

interface UpdatePizzaTopping {
  type: "🍄" | "🌶️" | "🥓";
  doubleIt: boolean;
}

const reducerTastyPizza = (baseState: PizzaState, action: UpdatePizzaTopping) =&gt; {
  const recipe = (draft: WritableDraft&lt;PizzaState&gt;) =&gt; {
    const topping = draft.toppings.find(topping =&gt; topping.type === action.type);
    if (!topping)
      return;

    topping.doubleIt = action.doubleIt;
  }

  const newState: PizzaState = produce(baseState, recipe);
  return newState;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which you would typically just write like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">const reducerTastyPizza = (state: PizzaState, action: UpdatePizzaTopping) =&gt; {
  return produce(state, draft =&gt; { /* do stuff here! */ });
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="outside-of-reduxjstoolkit">Outside of ReduxJS/Toolkit</h2>

<p>Immer can be useful even if you are not using ReduxJS/Toolkit. Or
just outside your reducers – you already have the dependency anyway!</p>

<p>In a form Component, you might have something like</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
const [text, setText] = useState("");
// If you've got 10 properties, then 10x useState???
</code></pre>

<h3 id="nimmer">Nimmer!</h3>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { produce } from "immer";

const TodoAdd = () =&gt; {
  const [todo, setTodo] = useState&lt;Todo&gt;(produce(() =&gt; ({
    title: '',
    text: '',
  })));

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;input
        value={todo.title}
        onChange={e =&gt; setTodo(produce(todo, draft =&gt; {draft.title = e.target.value}))}
      /&gt;
      &lt;textarea
        value={todo.text}
        onChange={e =&gt; setTodo(produce(todo, draft =&gt; {draft.text = e.target.value}))}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Uhoh, <code>setTodo(produce(todo, draft...))</code>, might as well stick with my 10x useState!</p>

<p>You can make this a lot nicer with a helper function, while still keeping
everything type-safe:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">const updateTodo = &lt;K extends keyof Todo&gt;(key: K, value: Todo[K]) =&gt; {
  setTodo(produce(todo, draft =&gt; {
    draft[key] = value;
  }));
}

return (
  &lt;input value={todo.title} onChange={e =&gt; updateTodo('title', e.target.value)} /&gt;
)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="useimmer">useImmer</h3>

<p>But of course there is a package for that!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">
    <a href="https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer" style="margin-right: 6px">

    </a>
    <a href="https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer">immerjs/use-immer</a>:
        Use immer to drive state with a React hooks</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { useImmer } from "use-immer";

const TodoAdd = () =&gt; {
  const [todo, setTodo] = useImmer&lt;Todo&gt;({
    title: '',
    text: '',
  });

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;input
        value={todo.title}
        onChange={e =&gt; setTodo(draft =&gt; draft.title = e.target.value)}
      /&gt;
      &lt;textarea

        onChange={e =&gt; setTodo(draft =&gt; draft.text = e.target.value)}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>use-immer</code> also exposes <code>useImmerReducer</code> to replace your <code>useReducer</code>s.</p>]]></block2>

    <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit">reduxjs/redux-toolkit</a>:
        The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development</p>

<p class="notice--info">This first post is context and can basically be ignored.<br />
The remainder of the series are no-nonsense pretty detailed explanations on how to start using
ReduxJS/Toolkit, assuming you’re basically already a “legacy” Redux expert but don’t want to read the
gazillion pages that is the <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started">default documentation</a>.</p>

<p>We’re 2025 and you start a new app with old, trusted and deprecated <code>create-react-app</code>,
only to find out that using Redux is also, deprecated.</p>

<p>During previous migrations I took a long hard look at the <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">ReduxJS/Toolkit documentation</a>
and I was like… Aint nobody got time for that!</p>

<p>For the last migration, I decided to give it go and well, I can already say with conviction,
it is worth the time learning. Reduced boilerplate, batteries included and while the full
documentation is still daunting, you can take it step by step.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="immer">Immer</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">

    </a>
    <a href="https://github.com/immerjs/immer">immerjs/immer</a>:
        Create the next immutable state by mutating the current one</p>

<p>Before we actually start with ReduxJS/Toolkit (RTK), let’s take a step back.</p>

<p>The application I was migrating was using <a href="https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js"><code>ImmutableJS</code></a> because you know, you want all store state to be immutable, your reducers pure, and it was all the rage back then.
For me though, the cure turned out to be worse than the disease. You could no longer just
do <code>state.someProp</code>, you had to do <code>state.get('someProp')</code>.</p>

<p>I rather just <code>...spread</code> all the way instead.</p>

<p>Immer is the solution the ReduxJS/Toolkit has adopted and I love how it allows you to write reducers
while (almost) not having to think about immutability anymore!</p>

<p><a href="/blog/javascript/reduxjs-toolkit-immer/">Part 2: Immer</a></p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="createslice-and-configurestore">createSlice and configureStore</h2>

<p>Okay, now that we’re Immer experts, let’s look at the two most important
exports of the Toolkit: <code>createSlice</code> and <code>configureStore</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>createSlice</code>: each top level object of your state is typically a slice</li>
  <li><code>configureStore</code>: abstracts away the pain that was <code>createStore</code></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/blog/javascript/reduxjs-toolkit-createslice/">Part 3: createSlice and configureStore</a></p>

<h2 id="createasyncthunk">createAsyncThunk</h2>

<p>On top of the included redux-thunk package, <code>createAsyncThunk</code> is the helper function for
all your API call needs.</p>

<p>Coming from “legacy Redux”, this is the last basic piece of ReduxJS/Toolkit!</p>

<p><a href="/blog/javascript/reduxjs-toolkit-createasyncthunk/">Part 4: createAsyncThunk</a></p>

<h2 id="typescript">TypeScript</h2>

<p>Keeping everything entirely type-safe.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/javascript/reduxjs-toolkit-typescript/">Part 5: TypeScript</a></p>

<h2 id="reselect">Reselect</h2>

<p>More batteries included. You basically only need this when running into
<a href="/blog/javascript/react-component-profiling/">performance issues</a>
which is like, almost never (if you thought things through). Because JavaScript is
just so damn fast these days.</p>

<p>Still, it’s a good idea to just use selectors from the get-go, that way, you will still
not be running into re-rendering performance issues after the addition of 6 years of production data.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/javascript/reduxjs-toolkit-createselector/">Part 6: createSelector</a></p>

<h2 id="rtk-query">RTK Query</h2>

<p>A much <strong>higher level of abstraction</strong>.<br />
Okay, we’re getting to the meat of ReduxJS/Toolkit now. Yes, only now.</p>

<p>When migrating from classes, plain JavaScript, and all that other stuff that was hot
back in the medieval ages, you may want to do the whole Immer, slices and asyncThunks
stuff; but RTK Query might just be a tad too much in what probably already is a whole
re-write.</p>

<p>There is pretty much an easy 1 to 1 conversion path there. When you want to go to all the way
and also adopt RTK Query, you’ll have to change (<del>a bit</del>) more.</p>

<p>Will it be worth it in the end? Yes. Will it hurt? Also yes.<br />
So maybe something you want to use for your next NEW React app ;)</p>

<p>Parts of this series that will probably not be written.</p>

<h3 id="other-features">Other Features</h3>

<p>Since I already spent way too much time on this 😀</p>

<p><strong>Listener Middleware</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createListenerMiddleware">Listener middleware</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://redux.js.org/usage/side-effects-approaches#why-listeners-for-reactive-logic">Why Listeners for Reactive Logic</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EntityAdapters</strong>:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createEntityAdapter">EntityAdapters</a>
are in fact quite handy. There is an example in <code>moreSlice</code> in the accompanying code.
If you are doing basic CRUD, this can significantly reduce the boilerplate EVEN MORE.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { createEntityAdapter, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const usersAdapter = createEntityAdapter({
  // In case "id" is not the name of the id property
  selectId: (user: User) =&gt; user.name,
  // Sorter for the "All IDs" array
  sortComparer: (a, b) =&gt; a.name.localeCompare(b.name),
});

export const usersSlice = createSlice({
  initialState: usersAdapter.getInitialState(),
  // initialState: {
  //   ids: Id[],
  //   entities: Record&lt;Id, T&gt;,
  // }
  reducers: {
    addUser: usersAdapter.addOne,
    addUsers: usersAdapter.addMany,
    updateUser: usersAdapter.updateOne,
    removeUser: usersAdapter.removeOne,
    // ... and many more fns ready for use
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>autoBatchEnhancer</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/autoBatchEnhancer">autoBatchEnhancer</a>
is the built-in (and automatically registered)
mechanic to delay low-priority actions.</p>

<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>

<p>A blog post that has been sitting on my todo list for the longest time is
“<em>Redux: The Good, The Bad and The Boilerplate</em>”.</p>

<p>ReduxJS/Toolkit proves that you don’t need the horror that is your typical
NGRX implementation. Your average enterprise backend developer has to do
something in the frontend and after the initial pants pissing you end up
with a custom selector for EVERYTHING topped with an Effect where the failure
action doesn’t do anything (or could be replaced with a single global interceptor)
sprinkled with a few Redux no-nos on top.</p>

<p>Yes, I’m quite frustrated by this boilerplate²².</p>

<p>Aside from the rant, that blog post would be something that explains basic Redux followed by what is
basically the Redux <a href="https://redux.js.org/style-guide/">Style Guide</a>.</p>]]></block2>

  <li>create-file.sh: <code>touch /export/export.csv</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nfwhat">NFWhat?</h3>

<p>NFS or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System">Network File System</a>,
a distributed file system protocol which allows you to access files over a network
as if they were on the local disk. It has been around since 1984 and is pretty much
the standard on Linux systems.</p>

<p>Thanks to NFS we get proper <code>inotify</code> events and CloudSync picks up our files.
Crisis averted!</p>

<h2 id="outside-cloudsync-folder">Outside CloudSync Folder</h2>

<p>It might not be possible to create the files directly into the folder that
CloudSync is active on.</p>

<p>The easy solution would be to create a symbolic link to the CloudSync folder;
but, of course, that doesn’t work.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">ln -s /volume1/Projects/GeneratedFiles /volume1/Dropbox/GeneratedProjectFiles
</code></pre>

<h3 id="scheduled-rsync-task">Scheduled rsync Task</h3>

<p>An easy solution here is creating a recurring task to run <code>rsync</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Synology DSM</li>
  <li>Control Panel &gt; Services &gt; Task Scheduler</li>
  <li>Create &gt; Scheduled Task &gt; User-defined script
    <ul>
      <li>General: Set a task name</li>
      <li>Schedule: I kept the default of a daily sync</li>
      <li>Task Settings &gt; Run command</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-sh">rsync -av --delete /volume1/Projects/GeneratedFiles /volume1/Dropbox
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a folder <code>GeneratedFiles</code> in <code>/volume1/Dropbox</code>.</p>

<p>rsync options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>-a</code>: Archive mode to preserve file attributes (permissions, timestamps etc)</li>
  <li><code>-v</code>: Verbose output. You’ll have to select a folder for the output in Task Scheduler &gt; Settings to actually see the output.</li>
  <li><code>--delete</code>: If your Docker container also deletes files</li>
  <li><code>--chown=CloudSync:CloudSync</code>: I didn’t have to change ownership for CloudSync to pick up the files</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course you could also just add this to the <code>docker-compose</code> 😀</p>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>Typically you want to write tests only for <code>public</code> methods.
You want to avoid writing tests for private methods
so that when you change the implementation, your tests
remain green and you can do that ruthless refactoring
without having to worry about introducing new bugs.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>The tests are your safety net you want to rely on!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>There are actually many cases where you want to do this:</p>

<h3 id="legacy-singletons">Legacy Singletons</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Legacy Code Dilemma</strong><br />
When we have to change code, we should have tests in place.<br />
To put tests in place, we often have to change code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your old legacy codebase has something like:<br />
(yeah, it’s probably a lot more convoluted than this)</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public class Singleton
{
  public static readonly Singleton Instance = new();
  private Singleton() { }
}
</code></pre>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h4 id="refactored-testable-singleton">Refactored Testable Singleton</h4>

<p>We introduce an interface, mimicking the original API
and provide an <code>internal</code> setter so that we can substitute
it with something else during testing!</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public class Singleton : ISingleton
{
  private static ISingleton _instance = new Singleton();

  public static ISingleton Instance
  {
    get =&gt; _instance;
    // We introduced a "seam"!
    internal set =&gt; _instance = value;
  }

  private Singleton() {}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="limiting-the-api-surface">Limiting the API surface</h3>

<p>Inside project X you have some helper classes/functions, a few Extension Methods,
or maybe part of your startup code has some logic in it.</p>

<p>These are all <code>internal</code> because you like your projects to have a clean
public API, exposing only those things that external users are interested in,
and hide everything else.</p>

<p>You don’t want to make them public, but obviously you do want to write tests
for them!</p>

<h3 id="when-not">When Not</h3>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public class Calculator
{
  public Result Calculate()
  {
    var step1 = Step1();
    var step2 = Step2(step1);
    return Step3(step2);
  }

  internal object Step1() {}
  internal object Step2(object data) {}
  internal Result Step3(object data) {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve seen code like this. Instead of testing the public
<code>Calculate</code> method only, there are also UnitTests for
the sub-algorithms, methods which have been made <code>internal</code>
only for those UnitTests.<br />
Maybe even mock out the <code>Step1-3</code> when testing the public
method 😲</p>

<p>It’s almost always a bad idea; as your implementation and
your tests are now very strongly tied together. It’s become hard
to change the sub-parts. Worse, if the requirements change,
<code>Step1-3</code> might not make much sense anymore but you’re probably
going to endure anyway rather than rewrite all those tests…</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p>This blog post was supposed to be just this but, well,
I got carried away…</p>

<h3 id="old-legacy-project-format">Old Legacy Project Format</h3>

<p>Create an <code>AssemblyInfo.cs</code> class and add:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Company.Project.UnitTests")]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="new-sdk-style-project-format">New SDK-Style Project Format</h3>

<p>Add to the <code>csproj</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;AssemblyAttribute Include="System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleTo"&gt;
    &lt;_Parameter1&gt;Company.Project.UnitTests&lt;/_Parameter1&gt;
  &lt;/AssemblyAttribute&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I could easily remember the <code>AssemblyInfo</code> version but
the <code>csproj</code> one… not so much.</p>

<p>Ready for copy-pasta now!</p>

<p>Somehow I ended up writing about “high cohesion”, “Working Effectively with Legacy Code”
and “encapsulation” instead!</p>]]></block2>

      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="option-1-created--modified-byon-triggers">Option 1: Created &amp; Modified By/On Triggers</h2>

<p>Each table has 4 extra columns to keep track of by who/when the record was created
and by who/when the record was last updated. Obviously little EF code is needed for
this solution 😀</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE TRIGGER TRG_Products_UPDATE
ON Products AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
  SET NOCOUNT ON;

  UPDATE Products
  SET ModifiedBy = SYSTEM_USER, ModifiedOn = GETDATE()
  WHERE Id IN (SELECT Id FROM inserted);
END;
</code></pre>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>The CreatedBy/On columns can be set with a default value for which
some EF configuration is needed:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
  // Required since EF Core 7:
  // Without this saving changes will fail
  modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Product&gt;()
    .ToTable(tb =&gt; tb.UseSqlOutputClause(false));

  // Set default values for CreatedOn/By
  // Also ignore property changes made in code:
  modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Product&gt;().Property(e =&gt; e.CreatedOn)
    .HasDefaultValueSql("GETDATE()")
    .ValueGeneratedOnAdd()
    .Metadata.SetBeforeSaveBehavior(PropertySaveBehavior.Ignore);

  modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Product&gt;().Property(e =&gt; e.CreatedBy)
    .HasDefaultValueSql("SYSTEM_USER")
    .ValueGeneratedOnAdd()
    .Metadata.SetBeforeSaveBehavior(PropertySaveBehavior.Ignore);

  // The ModifiedOn/By are set by the trigger but still
  // require some EF configuration:
  modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Product&gt;().Property(e =&gt; e.ModifiedOn)
    .ValueGeneratedOnAddOrUpdate()
    .Metadata.SetBeforeSaveBehavior(PropertySaveBehavior.Ignore);

  // We're not using ValueGeneratedOnUpdate() because that
  // would allow a value to be set in code during insertion
  modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Product&gt;().Property(e =&gt; e.ModifiedBy)
    .ValueGeneratedOnAddOrUpdate()
    .Metadata.SetBeforeSaveBehavior(PropertySaveBehavior.Ignore);
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="usesqloutputclausefalse">UseSqlOutputClause(false)</h3>

<p>Required for all tables that have triggers <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-7.0/breaking-changes?tabs=v7#sqlserver-tables-with-triggers">since EF Core 7</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Product&gt;().ToTable(tb =&gt; tb.UseSqlOutputClause(false));
</code></pre>

<p>This reverts the behavior of EF back to that of older versions of EF, a less performant
way of capturing the generated Ids during insertion.</p>

<h3 id="pros-vs-cons">Pros vs Cons</h3>

<p>✅ All changes to the table are captured, not just those done by the application<br />
⚠️ Changes made by the application are typically all done with the same database user, not the actual user<br />
⚠️ Need to revert to a less performant way of inserting records, which could be a problem for bulk inserts<br />
⚠️ This approach just keeps track of the last modification and doesn’t tell you <strong>what</strong> has changed</p>

<h2 id="option-2-created--modified-byon-by-ef">Option 2: Created &amp; Modified By/On by EF</h2>

<p>Doing exactly the same thing but this time we let EF do the heavy lifting.</p>

<h3 id="abstraction-userprovider">Abstraction: UserProvider</h3>

<p>EF somehow needs to know who the current user is, so let’s create a little abstraction
and inject the correct implementation depending on the runtime context.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public interface IUserProvider
{
  string UserName { get; }
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;A simple ASP.NET implementation&lt;/summary&gt;
public class HttpUserProvider(IHttpContextAccessor accessor) : IUserProvider
{
  public string UserName =&gt; accessor.HttpContext?.User?.Identity?.Name ?? "???";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>DbContext</code> now needs this <code>IUserProvider</code>, something the <code>dotnet ef</code> CLI doesn’t like.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public class MyDbContextFactory : IDesignTimeDbContextFactory&lt;MyDbContext&gt;
{
  public MyDbContext CreateDbContext(string[] args)
  {
    return new MyDbContext(new FakeUserProvider());
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="abstraction-audit-owned-entity">Abstraction: Audit Owned Entity</h3>

<p>By having all our entities implement <code>IAudit</code> we can configure the <code>Audit</code> <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>
for all our entities as an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/owned-entities">Owned entity</a>.
This way we don’t have 4 properties in all our entities cluttering our intellisense.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public interface IAudit
{
  Audit Audit { get; }
}

public class Audit
{
  public DateTime CreatedOn { get; set; }
  [StringLength(50)]
  public string CreatedBy { get; set; } = "";
  public DateTime? ModifiedOn { get; set; }
  [StringLength(50)]
  public string? ModifiedBy { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="the-dbcontext-implementation">The DbContext Implementation</h3>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public class MyDbContext(IUserProvider userProvider) : DbContext
{
  protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
  {
    var entities = modelBuilder.Model.GetEntityTypes()
      .Where(entityType =&gt; typeof(IAudit).IsAssignableFrom(entityType.ClrType))
      .ToArray();

    foreach (var entityType in entities)
    {
      modelBuilder.Entity(entityType.ClrType)
        .OwnsOne(typeof(Audit), nameof(IAudit.Audit), audit =&gt;
        {
            audit.Property(nameof(Audit.CreatedOn)).HasColumnName(nameof(Audit.CreatedOn));
            audit.Property(nameof(Audit.CreatedBy)).HasColumnName(nameof(Audit.CreatedBy));
            audit.Property(nameof(Audit.ModifiedOn)).HasColumnName(nameof(Audit.ModifiedOn));
            audit.Property(nameof(Audit.ModifiedBy)).HasColumnName(nameof(Audit.ModifiedBy));
        });
    }
  }

  public override int SaveChanges()
  {
    // You may want to override SaveChangesAsync too!
    SetAuditFields();
    return base.SaveChanges();
  }

  private void SetAuditFields()
  {
    var entries = ChangeTracker
      .Entries&lt;IAudit&gt;()
      .Where(e =&gt; e.State is EntityState.Added or EntityState.Modified);

    foreach (var entityEntry in entries)
    {
      Audit audit = entityEntry.Entity.Audit;
      if (entityEntry.State == EntityState.Added)
      {
        audit.CreatedOn = DateTime.Now;
        audit.CreatedBy = userProvider.UserName;
        // Make sure a dev hasn't set these
        // But really... You know, just don't set them...
        audit.ModifiedOn = null;
        audit.ModifiedBy = null;
      }
      else
      {
        audit.ModifiedOn = DateTime.Now;
        audit.ModifiedBy = userProvider.UserName;

        // Here we also revert any changes made in code to the CreatedBy/On properties
        // Again, this should go without saying and is probably just overhead...
        var originalAudit = entityEntry.Reference(e =&gt; e.Audit).TargetEntry!;
        audit.CreatedBy = originalAudit.OriginalValues.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(nameof(Audit.CreatedBy));
        audit.CreatedOn = originalAudit.OriginalValues.GetValue&lt;DateTime&gt;(nameof(Audit.CreatedOn));
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you really don’t trust your team or something, the github repository
also contains code where the <code>Audit</code> only has getters and everything is set using
reflection.</p>

<h3 id="pros-vs-cons-1">Pros vs Cons</h3>

<p>✅ Captures the actual user that made the request<br />
⚠️ Changes done directly in the database are not tracked<br />
⚠️ This approach just keeps track of the last modification and doesn’t tell you <strong>what</strong> has changed</p>

<h2 id="option-3-separate-audit-table-with-trigger">Option 3: Separate Audit Table with Trigger</h2>

<p>We create a separate table and track all changes to all our tables with a trigger.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE TRIGGER [dbo].[TRG_Products_ALL] ON [dbo].[Products]
AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
AS
BEGIN
SET NOCOUNT ON;

-- This trigger also updates the Products table ModifiedOn/By
-- But we don't want to create audit records for that!
IF TRIGGER_NESTLEVEL(OBJECT_ID('dbo.TRG_Products_ALL')) &gt; 1
  RETURN;

IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM deleted) AND NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM inserted)
  RETURN;

DECLARE @ActionType CHAR(1)
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM inserted)
  IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM deleted)
    SELECT @ActionType = 'U'
  ELSE
    SELECT @ActionType = 'I'
ELSE
  SELECT @ActionType = 'D'

DECLARE @inserted XML, @deleted XML
SET @inserted = (SELECT * FROM inserted FOR XML PATH)
SET @deleted = (SELECT * FROM deleted FOR XML PATH)

DECLARE @tableIds VARCHAR(MAX);
SET @tableIds = (SELECT STRING_AGG(CAST(Id AS VARCHAR(MAX)), ',') FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Id FROM (SELECT Id FROM inserted UNION SELECT Id from deleted) ids) distinctIds)

INSERT INTO [Audit] (TableName, TableIds, ActionType, OldValues, NewValues)
SELECT 'Products', @tableIds, @ActionType, @deleted, @inserted;

IF @ActionType = 'U'
  UPDATE dbo.[Products]
  SET ModifiedOn=CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, ModifiedBy=SUSER_SNAME()
  WHERE [Id] IN (SELECT [Id] FROM inserted);

END;
</code></pre>

<p>This inserts XML with the changes in Audit.OldValues &amp; NewValues.
If you want to use this approach for many tables, you probably want to abstract this in a function or something 😉</p>

<h3 id="pros-vs-cons-2">Pros vs Cons</h3>

<p>✅ All changes to the table are captured, not just those done by the application<br />
✅ This approach keeps track of all modifications<br />
⚠️ Changes made by the application are typically all done with the same database user, not the actual user<br />
⚠️ Need to revert to a less performant way of inserting records, which could be a problem for bulk inserts<br />
⚠️ Huge update statements could overflow some of the Audit columns. This could be fixed by inserting a record for every single TableId</p>

<h2 id="option-4-separate-audit-table-with-ef">Option 4: Separate Audit Table with EF</h2>

<p>We do exactly the same but with EF doing the heavy lifting.
The Old/NewValues are stored as JSON, not as XML.</p>

<h3 id="abstraction-iid">Abstraction: IId</h3>

<p>We need to get the db ID to insert it into the Audit table!<br />

</code></pre>

<p>If you are doing EventSourcing, you already have this.
It also allows you to implement this in different ways.</p>

<h3 id="pros-vs-cons-3">Pros vs Cons</h3>

<p>✅ This approach keeps track of all modifications<br />
✅ Captures the actual user that made the request<br />
⚠️ Changes done directly in the database are not tracked</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It depends? 🤷</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you care who has changed what in your tables directly/manually or using other applications?</li>
  <li>Do you care what exactly has changed over time and by whom?</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, if you trust no one, you could also implement a combination of triggers and EF to
really track everything 😀</p>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>This month our QA TechEvent was “SQL Training”. Goal was to score most points by solving
more and more complex SQL exercises against three datasets: countries of the world,
teachers + departments (postgres) and the football worldcups (sql server).</p>

<p>Which country scored the most owngoals? Read on to find out!</p>

      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>

<p>The game started with a hickup, other machines were not discoverable on the guest network so the leaderboard server had to be deployed on an external server – while everyone was already solving exercises! This messed up our scoreboard considerably, especially the ranking for “solved fastest” 😃</p>

<p>After this it was pretty smooth sailing. Tom found an error in the calculation of the query to calculate the average GDP per capita in South America. That and other small issues were fixed on the spot, on production – as it should! 😉</p>]]></block1>

<h3 id="notable-hacks">Notable Hacks</h3>

<p>Even though we had definitely said “no cheating” during the intro powerpoint, some contestants still tried to get extra points for “leanest solution” or just “fixed” their query to get to the hinted at result 😀</p>

<h4 id="mike">Mike</h4>

<p>Q: <em>Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe?</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">select name
from countries
where gdp &gt; 3425956000000
-- I think we were looking instead for this:
-- WHERE gdp &gt; (SELECT MAX(gdp) FROM countries WHERE continent='Europe')
order by gdp
</code></pre>

<p>Straight to jail Mike! ;)</p>

<h4 id="alexander">Alexander</h4>

<p>Alexander scored some <code>+4</code> style points for this one!</p>

<p>Q: <em>Select the year of the worldcup in which the most penalties were scored, also select the amount of penalties.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT top 1 s.name, COUNT(*)+4 AS o
FROM goals g JOIN matches m ON g.match_id = m.id
JOIN groups a ON m.group_id = a.id
JOIN events e ON a.event_id = e.id JOIN seasons s ON e.season_id = s.id
WHERE g.penalty = 1
GROUP BY s.name order by o desc
</code></pre>

<p>The reason was the join on the <code>groups</code> table. This led to penalties scored after the “group phase”
to not be counted in his query!</p>

<h3 id="the-leaderboards">The Leaderboards</h3>

<p>The 🏆 top 4 on the final leaderboard 💯:</p>

<table class="table-code">
  <thead>
    <tr>

<h2 id="host-your-own">Host Your Own?</h2>

<p>You want to host your own SQL Training competition?<br />
You can! The game, exercises and datasets are on our <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/sql-training">Github</a>!</p>

<p>Each contestant runs his own React frontend and databases with Docker:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git clone https://github.com/itenium-be/sql-training
cd sql-training
docker compose up -d --build
</code></pre>

<p>The game leader hosts the leaderboard:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">cd sql-leaderboard
cp .env.template .env
docker compose up -d --build
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll have to change some configuration (see the <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/sql-training/blob/master/README.md">README</a>) but that’s basically it!<br />
Possible solutions can be found on a separate <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/sql-training/blob/solutions/SOLUTIONS.md">branch</a>.</p>

<h2 id="interesting-queries">Interesting Queries</h2>

<h3 id="world-largest-country-per-continent">World: largest country per continent</h3>

<p>Q: <em>Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area.</em></p>

<p>During the preparation, I solved this exercise with the following query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT continent, name, area
FROM countries
WHERE area = (
  SELECT MAX(area)
  FROM countries AS subquery
  WHERE subquery.continent = countries.continent
)
ORDER BY continent
</code></pre>

<p>Mike was using ChatGPT extensively and by just entering the exercise question, it came up with the following
query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT DISTINCT ON (continent), continent, name, area
FROM countries
ORDER BY continent, area DESC
</code></pre>

<p>A pretty interesting solution which won him the “leanest query” award for this question. I didn’t even
know the <code>DISTINCT ON (col_name)</code> was a thing!</p>

<p>It’s the <code>ORDER BY area DESC</code> part that makes this work. Pretty neat!</p>

<h3 id="world-all-vowels-no-spaces">World: all vowels, no spaces</h3>

<p>Q: <em>Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.</em></p>

<p>Michael came up with a cool solution for this one:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">select name from countries where name not like ('% %')
and name like all (array['%a%', '%e%', '%i%', '%o%', '%u%'])
</code></pre>

<p>But I was surprised no one solved this with a good old regex!?
It would most definitely have won the “leanest query” award!</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT name FROM countries
WHERE name ~ '^(?=.*a)(?=.*e)(?=.*i)(?=.*o)(?=.*u)[^ ]+$'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="teachers-teacher-seniority">Teachers: Teacher seniority</h3>

<p>Typically calculated like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(NOW(), employed_at)) AS seniority
</code></pre>

<p>Michael won the leanest query by instead doing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">(CURRENT_DATE - employed_at)/365
</code></pre>

<h3 id="worldcup-country-with-most-own-goals">Worldcup: country with most own goals</h3>

<p>As promised in the intro…</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT TOP 1 c.name, COUNT(g.id) AS owngoals
FROM goals g
JOIN teams t ON g.team_id = t.id
JOIN countries c ON t.country_id = c.id
WHERE g.owngoal = 1
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY owngoals DESC
</code></pre>

<p>And the “winner” is… France, with 4 own goals!<br />
(Valladdares, Yobo, Behich, Mandžukic)</p>

<h3 id="unsolved">Unsolved</h3>

<p><strong>World-8</strong>: Get confusing top level domains: tld that start/end in a different country name.<br />
An exercise on joining a table with itself.</p>

<p><strong>Woldcup-4</strong>: Find players that played for different countries and a “,” separated list of countries they played for.</p>

<p><strong>Worldcup-5</strong>: Which countries always survived the “Group Stage” when present? (A round not called “Matchday”)</p>

<p><strong>Worldcup-6</strong>: For the player that scored the most goals, list the worldcup.YYYY, the round name, the match date, the goal minute, scored Y/N and the total amount of goals scored so far. To keep things “simple”, evaluate only events.id 20, 21 and 22 and team.id 1.</p>

<p>Anyone willing to give them a go? 😀</p>]]></block2>

        Git hooks made easy 🐶 woof!</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="hooks">Hooks</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>git hooks</strong><br />
Run a program before certain points in gits execution.<br />
<code>pre-commit</code> and <code>pre-push</code> hooks are probably the most interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are defined in <code>.git/hooks</code>.
You can find some example files in that directory. Remove their <code>.sample</code> suffix
to test them out.</p>

<p>The githooks are saved locally and not pushed to the remote. This is obviously a problem
when working in a team but the <code>.git/hooks</code> folder can be changed globally or for the current repository
with the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-corehooksPath"><code>core.hooksPath</code></a>
setting.</p>

<p>This is obviously never going to happen but you could skip githooks with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git commit --no-verify
git push --no-verify

# Or if you want to really quickly skip it ;)
git commit -n
</code></pre>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="husky">Husky</h2>

<p>Or, use Husky to easily make the git hooks part of the repository itself and share it with the entire team.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install husky --save-dev
npx husky init
</code></pre>

<p>This will add a <code>prepare</code> npm script in your <code>package.json</code>. The prepare script runs after
an <code>npm install</code> to ensure things are setup for everyone.</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">"scripts": {
  "prepare": "husky"
},
</code></pre>

<p>And it creates a <code>.husky/pre-commit</code> which you can try out by doing a <code>git commit</code>!<br />
Avoid having to <code>git reset HEAD~</code> all the time by ending your script with <code>exit 1</code> while
testing/setting it up.</p>

<p>Finally it sets the <code>core.hooksPath</code> to <code>.husky/_</code>. Husky creates files in that
directory to link all githooks with the <code>h</code> shell script which will execute a
<code>.husky/SOME_GITHOOK</code> if it exists.<br />
Husky also adds a gitignore to the <code>_</code> folder to keep the generated files out
of your git repository.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git config core.hooksPath
# --&gt; .husky/_
</code></pre>

<h3 id="script-h">Script <code>h</code></h3>

<p>In this order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If <code>HUSKY=2</code> it executes <code>set -x</code> to print commands with arguments</li>
  <li>If the <code>.husky/XXX</code> file does not exist (with XXX for example <code>pre-commit</code>), the script exits</li>
  <li>If <code>~/.config/husky/init.sh</code> (or <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/husky/init.sh</code>) exists, it executes it
    <ul>
      <li>This is the place to setup <code>PATH</code>, or set an environment variable like <code>NVM_DIR</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If <code>HUSKY=0</code> the script exits</li>
  <li>It adds <code>node_modules/.bin</code> to the <code>PATH</code></li>
  <li>It executes <code>.husky/XXX</code> (stops on first error)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cicd">CI/CD</h3>

<p>You may not be installing the <code>devDependencies</code> during a production build.
To avoid the <code>prepare</code> npm script from failing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">"scripts": {
  "prepare": "husky || true"
},
</code></pre>

<h3 id="project-not-in-git-root-directory">Project Not in Git Root Directory</h3>

<p>Prepush script that works around the frontend project <code>package.json</code> not being in the
root of the git repository.</p>

<p>Set the <code>package.json</code> script manually and then do an <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">"scripts": {
  "prepare": "cd .. &amp;&amp; husky frontend/.husky"
},
</code></pre>

<p>The script with some path juggling:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/sh

# Path Juggling
originalPath=`pwd`
if [ "`git rev-parse --show-cdup`" != "" ]; then cd `git rev-parse --show-cdup`; fi
cd ./frontend-project-folder/

# Linting
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    cd $originalPath
    exit -1
fi

# Testing
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  cd $originalPath
  exit -1
fi

# Build
npm run build
hasBuildErrors=$?

cd $originalPath
exit $hasBuildErrors
</code></pre>

    // Actual Business Logic here
    // But... Only happening for
    // one case?
  }
}
</code></pre>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>And then another implementation, a decorator:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public class LoopingDoer : IDoer
{
  private readonly IDoer _inner;

  public LoopingDoer(IDoer inner)
  {
    _inner = inner;
  }

  public void DoIt()
  {
    // We were looping over something
    // that made sense here, not just
    // this for loop:
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
    {
      _inner.DoIt();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="the-magic">The Magic</h3>

<p>To make it all work, the “magic” ✨🦄 <a href="https://autofac.org/">Autofac</a>
wiring:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">var containerBuilder = new ContainerBuilder();
containerBuilder.RegisterType&lt;Doer&gt;().As&lt;IDoer&gt;();
containerBuilder.RegisterDecorator&lt;LoopingDoer, IDoer&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Probably there is no one in your team who knows
what this does exactly and they’d have to look
at a completely different location (app startup) before it
makes any sense.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it Simple</h2>

<p>After removing the decorator and the Autofac registration,
we ended up with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public class Doer : IDoer
{
  public void DoIt()
  {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
    {
      // Business Logic here

      // New UseCase example
      if (i == 0)
      {
        // UserStory implementation here
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is less code and much easier to
understand, and it also made it easy, trivial even,
to add the required change.</p>

<h2 id="decorator-pattern">Decorator Pattern</h2>

<p>An excellent design pattern to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle:
Add functionality without modification.</p>

<h3 id="intent">Intent</h3>

<p>It’s one of the Structural Patterns from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">GoF</a>.</p>

<p class="notice--info">Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for
extending functionality.</p>

<h3 id="applicability">Applicability</h3>

<p>When extension by subclassing is impractical because a large number
of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion
of subclasses to support every combination.</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p><em>More flexible than static inheritance</em>:<br />
Responsibilities can be added and removed at run-time whereas inheritance
requires creating a new class for each new combination.</p>

<p><em>Avoids feature-laden classes</em>:<br />
Instead of trying to support all features in a complex, customizable class,
you define a simple class and add functionality incrementally with Decorator
objects.</p>

<p><em>Lots of little objects</em>:<br />
The objects differ only in the way they are interconnected. Although easy to
customize, <strong>you can no longer follow the execution flow from the source code
alone and they can be hard to debug</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="known-uses">Known Uses</h3>

<p>I/O Streams are typically implemented using Decorators and they are a really
good fit for the pattern too!</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">byte[] buffer = "test"u8.ToArray();

using (FileStream fileStream = new(path, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
using (BufferedStream bufferedStream = new(fileStream))
using (GZipStream gzipStream = new(bufferedStream, CompressionMode.Compress))
{
  gzipStream.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We cleanly avoid having to create a <code>GZipBufferedFileStream</code> for this particular
case. Having to write all these implementations would result in said explosion
of subclasses and also make it difficult to keep things DRY!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Using the decorator pattern
instead of writing a simple <code>foreach</code> loop;
it’s just adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">accidental complexity</a>.</p>

<p>You end up with the consequences of the design pattern (hard to learn and debug)
without any of the benefits.</p>

<p>Keep It Simple.</p>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p class="notice--info">Q: How do you install Node?<br />
A: Well, you don’t!</p>

<p>You install NVM (Node Version Manager) because
every project uses a different versions and
they are not always that compatible!</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="node-version-manager">Node Version Manager</h2>

<p>Install the <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nvm">nvm package</a> with <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">chocolatey</a>.
There is also a <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nvm.portable">portable version</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">choco install nvm

<p>NVM usage typically requires an Administrative prompt.</p>

nvm

# List available node versions
nvm list available

# Use a specific node version
nvm install 22.1.0
nvm use 22.1.0

<p>The Github repo of the session lists the Node version used at the top of the README.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h2>

<p>Looks like it’s already 5 years since I switched from Sublime Text 3 to Visual Studio Code.
While all attendees can obviously pick whichever IDE they fancy, if you don’t have strong
convictions about your IDE for frontend development (yet), you can’t go wrong with VSC.</p>

<p>Learning to use your IDE well is Pragmatic Tip 22. Learn those shortcuts, macro’s, install
fancy plugins, learn how to work with multiple cursors etc. You’ll be typing quite a lot
during your career, better do it elegantly!</p>

<p>Previous blog posts on setting up and learning about Visual Studio Code:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://itenium.be/blog/dev-setup/pragmatic-tip-22-use-a-single-editor-well/">Pragmatic Tip #22 : Use A Single Editor Well</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://itenium.be/blog/dev-setup/vscode-editor/">VSCode: Editor Settings and Shortcuts</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="syncing-settings">Syncing Settings</h3>

<p>Back when those posts were written, Visual Studio Code didn’t have a builtin option
to sync your settings so I did it with our <a href="https://github.com/Laoujin/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>. But now it’s just a
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync">menu option</a> away.</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/frontend-track-turn-on-sync.png" alt="Turn on sync in Visual Studio Code" title="Turn on sync in Visual Studio Code" /></p>

<p>Especially useful when you have an installation on your home and work laptops, or when
you change projects!</p>

<h3 id="plugins">Plugins</h3>

<p>Each itenium session lists its own set of suggested Visual Studio Code plugins
in the README.</p>

<p>If you start doing “Angular” development, or “Flutter”, just <code>Control + Shift + X</code> and search for it,
you see a plugin with a few million downloads? It’s probably worth checking out.</p>

<p>You can’t go wrong with these for frontend development:</p>

<h2 id="browser-extensions">Browser Extensions</h2>

<p>Unlike your preferred IDE, while you can use whichever browser you like for your day-to-day development,
you do need all browsers installed so that you can at least do some initial testing in Chrome, Firefox
and Edge; and maybe in a few less known ones, like Opera.<br />
This can also come in handy when testing something for which you need users with different roles. Have
the Admin use Chrome and the regular user Firefox and you can perform tests without having to logout/login
all the time.</p>

<p>That being said, the browser extensions are available for pretty much all browsers:</p>

<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>

<p>While there are some devs out there that don’t like TypeScript,
personally I use TypeScript even for the smallest of projects.</p>

<p>We covered the latest features of ECMAScript and the power
of TypeScript in our session <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/ModernJS">ModernJS</a></p>

<p>These days most libraries ship their own type definitions but if one doesn’t
it’s probably available in <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a></p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell"># Add TypeScript to package.json
npm install typescript --save-dev
</code></pre>

<p>You want to configure yourself a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/"><code>tsconfig.json</code></a>.
See this <a href="https://www.totaltypescript.com/tsconfig-cheat-sheet">tsconfig cheat sheet</a></p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // Use all the latest ECMAScript goodness
    "lib": ["es2024", "dom", "dom.iterable"]

<h3 id="jest">Jest</h3>

<p>Jest has come a long way and I would definitely recommend for
your frontend UnitTesting needs.</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest @jest/globals

# Setup a jest.config.ts that works with TypeScript
npx ts-jest config:init

# Run tests
npm t
</code></pre>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues/4081">complains</a> about:</p>

<pre><code>TS1286: ESM syntax is not allowed in a CommonJS module when 'verbatimModuleSyntax' is enabled.
</code></pre>

<p>We override this for the tests with an extra <code>__test__</code> or <code>spec</code> tsconfig:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": false
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And update the <code>jest.config.js</code> to use this tsconfig:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">/** @type {import('ts-jest').JestConfigWithTsJest} **/
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: "node",
  transform: {
    "^.+.tsx?$": ["ts-jest",{
      tsconfig: './spec/tsconfig.json'
    }],
  },
};
</code></pre>

<h3 id="visual-studio-code-1">Visual Studio Code</h3>

<p>Run the tests directly in Visual Studio Code with
the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest">Jest Plugin</a>.</p>

<p>And add a <code>.vscode/launch.json</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "name": "Debug Jest Tests",
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "runtimeArgs": [
    "--inspect-brk",
    "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/jest",
    "--runInBand"
  ],
  "console": "integratedTerminal",
  "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",
  "port": 9229
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you can’t see failure details, open the Terminal <code>Ctrl+J</code>!</p>

      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="initial-load">Initial Load</h2>

<p>Scripts are executed in alphabetical order,
executed on <code>MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE</code>.</p>

<p>For Mongo &lt;6 by <code>mongo</code> and by <code>mongosh</code> for mongo &gt;=6.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/Docker-Mongo">Github Docker-Mongo Repository</a>
for these examples.</p>

<h3 id="with-javascript">With JavaScript</h3>

<p>Example <code>compose.yaml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">services:
  mongo-js:
    container_name: mongo-js-load
    image: mongo
    volumes:
      - db-js:/data/db
      - ./load-js:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    ports:
      - "27009:27017"
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: jsapp
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: ${MONGO_USER}
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MONGO_PWD}

volumes:
  db-js: {}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>.env</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ini">MONGO_USER=mongoadmin
MONGO_PWD=pwd
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>load-js</code> directory contains a <code>load.js</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">db.celebrities.insertMany([
  { name: "Jon Skeet" },
  { name: "Martin Fowler" },
  { name: "Erich Gamma" }
]);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="with-shell">With Shell</h3>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">services:
  mongo-sh:
    container_name: mongo-sh-load
    image: mongo
    volumes:
      - db-sh:/data/db
      - ./load-sh/scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
      - ./load-sh/data:/mongo-seed-jsons
    ports:
      - "27008:27017"
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: shapp
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: ${MONGO_USER}
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MONGO_PWD}

volumes:
  db-sh: {}
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>load-sh/data</code> put your json files to be imported.</p>

<p>You can either already provide the ids in the json
with <code>"_id": { "$oid": "5bb0b3050581bf10c4bb89c3" }</code>
or omit the <code>_id</code> to have mongo create one for you.</p>

<p>In <code>load-sh/scripts</code> you can import the jsons with
a <code>.sh</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh"># A json with an []
mongoimport --db $MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE \
  --collection celebrities \
  --jsonArray \
  --file /mongo-seed-jsons/celebrities.json \
  --authenticationDatabase admin \
  --username $MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME \
  --password $MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD

# A json with a single {}
mongoimport --db $MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE \
  --collection socials \
  --file /mongo-seed-jsons/socials.json \
  --authenticationDatabase admin \
  --username $MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME \
  --password $MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
</code></pre>

<h2 id="mongo-shell">Mongo Shell</h2>

<pre><code class="language-sh"># With mongo-js-load the name of the container
# And jsapp the database name
docker exec -it mongo-js-load mongosh \
  --username mongoadmin \
  --password pwd \
  --authenticationDatabase admin \
  jsapp
</code></pre>

<p>In the shell:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">db.celebrities.find()

use admin
show collections
exit
</code></pre>

<p>If you just want to bash into it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">docker exec -it mongo-js-load sh
</code></pre>

<h2 id="mongodconf">mongod.conf</h2>

<p>By default mongo will not load any conf file. If you want to work
with a custom <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/configuration-options/">mongod.conf</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">services:
  mongo-conf:
    container_name: mongo-conf
    image: mongo
    command:
      - '-f'
      - '/etc/mongod.conf'
    volumes:
      - db-conf:/data/db
      - ./mongod.conf:/etc/mongod.conf
    ports:
      - "27007:27007"
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: ${MONGO_USER}
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MONGO_PWD}

volumes:
  db-conf: {}
</code></pre>

<p>The container port is <code>27007</code> because of this
<code>mongod.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">net:
  port: 27007
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the container check <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/configuration/#std-label-base-config"><code>/etc/mongod.conf.orig</code></a> for a basic one. Or if you have installed it locally:</p>

<table class="table-code">

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>Get into the <code>mongosh</code> without credentials and then do
everything in the shell itself.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-users/">Users in Self-Managed Deployments</a>
in the mongo docs for more!</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">docker exec -it mongo-secure mongosh

use admin
db.auth("mongoadmin", "pwd")

use otherDb
db.createUser({
  user: 'otherDbReader',
  pwd: 'pwd',
  roles: [{
    role: 'read',
    db: 'otherDb'
  }]

</code></pre>

<h3 id="with-initial-load">With Initial Load</h3>

<p>In a <code>js</code> file. Mongo 6 supports <code>process.env</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">db.createUser({
  user: 'user2',
  pwd: process.env.USER2_PWD,
  roles: [{
    role: 'read',
    db: 'someDb'

<p>Before mongo 6, use a <code>sh</code> file instead:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">mongosh &lt;&lt;EOF

    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>It seems that pretty much everyone is using
some sort of UI for their git interactions.</p>

<p>Which is obviously fine, until they are about to create a
commit, in which case it’s using the “add all changes”-button
and commit.</p>

<p>Good PR hygiene starts with keeping your commits small and
focused: check your changes and exclude everything that
is not part of the UserStory per se.</p>

<p>That’s why I advocate the use of <code>git add --patch</code> which gives
you fine-grained control of exactly what you’re going to
commit!</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>You basically want to avoid forcing your colleagues to review
mega PRs for what could have been much smaller, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/git-hygiene-pr.png" alt="Everyone loves reviewing such PR!" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>These either result in your PR being open for a very long time
(with all the merge conflicts that entails!)
or the reviewer losing patience/focus and just approving
after the first 20 files – both are outcomes that are not ideal.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="pr-preparation">PR Preparation</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-stage-your-changes">Step 1: Stage your changes</h3>

<pre><code class="language-sh"># Shorter
git add -p

# Or even shorter with an alias
git config --global alias.adp 'add -p'
</code></pre>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>git add –patch</strong><br />
Interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and the work tree and add them to the index. This gives the user a chance to review the difference before adding modified contents to the index.</p>

<p>Note that this will not add new files,
you still have to add those with a <code>git add new_file</code>!</p>

<p>For each hunk you have a few options, the most common:</p>

<table class="table-code">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>y/n</td>
      <td>Add or don’t add the hunk</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>a/d</td>
      <td>Add all hunks in the file or skip to the next file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>s</td>
      <td>Split the hunk into smaller ones</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>Decide manually on a line-per-line basis</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>q</td>
      <td>Quit. Whenever it turns out there is still some work left!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="step-2-review-the-staging-area">Step 2: Review the staging area</h3>

<p>Before doing the actual commit, go over all staged
changes: are you about to commit everything that
is needed, and nothing more?</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git diff --staged

# With an alias of course!
git config --global alias.dfc 'diff --staged'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="step-3-commit">Step 3: Commit!</h3>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/git-hygiene-commit-message.jpg" alt="Commit messages matter!" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Don’t write your life’s story (at least not in a commit message!)
but do add something meaningful, what exactly are you changing?
Are you fixing a bug, improving performance, doing source-code cleanup,
a refactoring or are you implementing a new feature?</p>

<p>I always try to get the entire team onboard for <strong>starting each commit message with a ticket ID</strong>
so that there is always a link back to your bug tracking system or Scrum
board. These artifacts are typically long-lived and may contain
additional information like a link to the analysis, comments from
team members, file attachments etc!</p>

<h3 id="step-4-create-the-pr">Step 4: Create the PR</h3>

<p>You obviously also want to automate this!
See our blog post on <a href="https://itenium.be/blog/dev-setup/exotic-git-recipes/#create-pr-in-browser">exotic git snippets</a>
for a small script to create a PR like a breeze.</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell"># Creating a PR from the commandline:
pr
</code></pre>

<h4 id="check-the-files-changed">Check the “Files changed”</h4>

<p>Since a PR typically exists of multiple commits,
before sending the PR to your colleague, make
sure to go through all your changes one last time.</p>

<h4 id="consider-a-pr-checklist">Consider a PR checklist</h4>

<p>Most systems allow you to create a file like
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository"><code>.github/pull_request_template.md</code></a>
where you can add a checklist of things that are recurring
comments from reviewer(s) that could’ve
been easily catched by the PR creator.</p>

<h2 id="poor-hygiene-examples">Poor Hygiene Examples</h2>

<h3 id="lingering-debug-statements">Lingering debug statements</h3>

<p>The PR still contains statements
that a quick glance would’ve catched:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">console.log('val', someValue);
debugger;
// TODO: xyz
</code></pre>

<p>You made some changes to speed up your manual testing,
that is OK but make sure you don’t commit this!!</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">function isLoggedIn() {
  // return !!this.userService.token;
  return true;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="should-never-have-been-committed">Should never have been committed</h3>

<p>Earlier this week I deleted an HTML file
which contained local test run results.</p>

<p>Typically everything that is generated should not be committed
as it can just be re-generated on the fly!<br />
There are exceptions, for example a <code>package-lock.json</code> is
generated but is used by a CI/CD pipeline to make sure
new <code>npm install</code>s the exact same thing.</p>

<p>Deleting such files is not enough though, create a PR
to add the file/folder to your <code>.gitignore</code> so that
this can never happen again!</p>

<p>When in doubt whether you should <code>.gitignore</code> something,
google it!</p>

<h3 id="avoid-superfluous-changes">Avoid Superfluous Changes</h3>

<p>These are changes that typically happen automatically on a save
and means that someone has a different linter installed,
or that they are running their linter with different settings 😲</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">-  constructor(private socksService: SocksService) {}
+  constructor(private socksService: SocksService) { }
</code></pre>

<p>Another classic, with one keystroke you can add missing imports
but of course your default IDE configuration is different from
the style that is used in 99% of the rest of the code base.</p>

<p>Fix your configuration or fix the styling, please!</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { Review } from './sock.model';
+import {TimeAgoPipe} from '../time-ago.pipe';
</code></pre>

<p>It’s cool to have an <a href="https://editorconfig.org/"><code>.editorconfig</code></a> but if not all devs
have the plugin installed in their IDE, it is pretty useless:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">-}
+}
\ No newline at end of file
</code></pre>

<p>Same for some extra whitespace at the end of a line: <code>&lt;router-outlet /&gt;</code>
vs <code>&lt;router-outlet /&gt;  </code>. Please don’t 🥺</p>

<p>Note that a git hook, for example with <a href="https://itenium.be/blog/dev-setup/git-hooks-with-husky/">Husky</a>,
can pretty much solve this in your team by automatically fixing all linting issues right before
a commit.</p>

<h3 id="not-needed-after-all">Not Needed After All</h3>

<p>If your first hunk is this one and there are no
others in the same file, I guess you moved the
code to somewhere else and forgot to clean up
your import statements!</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">+import { LOCALE_ID } from '@angular/core';
</code></pre>

<p>You added a new package but didn’t end up actually using it
or ended up using another one? Remove the dependency!</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">"dependencies": {
+  "cool-package-i-did-not-use-in-the-end": "1.0.0",
+  "@types/cool-package-i-did-not-use-in-the-end": "1.0.0",
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that dev stuff should be in <code>devDependencies</code>!</p>

<h3 id="local-configuration">Local Configuration</h3>

<p>Manual or automatic changes for local dev configuration should never be
checked in! That db connectionString on your local machine has no place
being in the official repo. Check our blog post on 
<a href="https://itenium.be/blog/dev-setup/git-assume-unchanged/#skip-worktree">Git Skip Worktree</a>
how you can make it easier to avoid this.</p>

<p>You are also opening up your project for a merge conflict on pretty much
every PR until eternity…</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">// PR from colleague A
"cli": { "analytics": false }

// PR from colleague B
"cli": { "analytics": "guid" }
</code></pre>

<h3 id="generated-and-useless">Generated and Useless</h3>

<p><code>ng generate</code>… So cool, so easy, and so many useless files
that all get checked in.</p>

<p>For each generated component there is a <code>component.scss</code> file. And
even if there is not a single styling rule added, obviously
the file gets checked in.</p>

<p>This is more an issue of “writing vs reading code”. Code
is written once, and then read many times over. Do you want
to spend time opening empty files, just to find out it is
indeed, empty? I know I don’t.</p>

<p>The other useless file is the <code>.spec.ts</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">describe('MyPipe', () =&gt; {
  it('creates an instance', () =&gt; {
    const pipe = new MyPipe();
    expect(pipe).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This test will, literally, <strong>never</strong> fail.
The <code>new</code> operator works, I guarantee it!</p>

<p>So either delete the file, or, even better,
actually write some tests for it!! Especially
as is the case here,
<a href="https://itenium.be/blog/javascript/angular-pipes/#testing">writing tests for an Angular Pipe</a>
is very straightforward!</p>

<p>Another thing the code generator seems to be
doing from time to time, re-order statements:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">-  imports: [NgIf, AsyncPipe, TitleCasePipe],
-  templateUrl: './sock.component.html'
+  templateUrl: './sock.component.html',
+  imports: [NgIf, AsyncPipe, TitleCasePipe, CurrencyPipe],
</code></pre>

<p>This makes the PR look bigger than it really is,
and also harder to spot what has actually changed.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Keep your PR short &amp; sweet, a mere glance through all
changed files will spot almost all these things.</p>

<p>It allows <strong>you</strong> to fix them instead getting comments from
the PR reviewer, that I would say are a bit embarrassing,
especially when it happens time and time again…</p>

<p>Here’s one last meme to keep the mood light:</p>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>You’ve got yourself a brand new Synology.
Now you need ssh, git and Docker so you
can actually start using it for more than,
you know, mere file storage.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="initial-setup">Initial Setup</h2>

<p>Getting started is really easy, after connecting
your NAS to your local network, navigate to
<a href="https://finds.synology.com/">finds.synology.com</a>
which figures out the local IP address
so you can start the DSM wizard at port 5000.</p>

<p>The DSM (DiskStation Manager) is their handy web UI
you can use to configure pretty much everything!</p>

<p>The wizard is pretty self-explanatory from there on out,
the only thing you may really want to think about
is which RAID you want to be using, for which
Synology conveniently offers you their
<a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/support/RAID_calculator">RAID Calculator</a>.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="local-ip">Local IP</h3>

<p>Who can remember some random default IP?<br />
Control Panel &gt; Connectivity &gt; Network:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Network Interface &gt; LAN 1 &gt; Edit &gt; IPv4 &gt; Use manual configuration</li>
  <li>General &gt; Server name: Remember that your DSM is also available as “serverName:5000”!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="external-access">External Access</h3>

<p>You will want to access your Synology even when not
on your local network. Signing into a Synology Account
is a necessary step here:<br />
Control Panel &gt; Services &gt; Synology Account</p>

<p>After that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>QuickConnect &gt; Enable QuickConnect: Which sets up an url like <code>QuickConnect.to/serverName</code></li>
  <li>DDNS &gt; Add: Keep your dynamic ISP IP in sync with your Synology
    <ul>
      <li>Service Provider &gt; Synology: Free <code>serverName.synology.me</code> (or other!) domain name.</li>
      <li>Enable Heartbeat: Get email notifications when your Synology goes down/back up.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-options">Other options</h3>

<p>Some other options you may want to tweak right away:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Notification &gt; Email &gt; Enable email notifications (ex for pwd reset, heartbeat, …)</li>
  <li>Control Panel &gt; Security &gt; Security &gt; Logout timer (default is 15min)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="user-setup">User Setup</h2>

<h3 id="passwordless-sign-in">Passwordless Sign-In</h3>

<p>Configure passwordless sign-in from the <i class="fa fa-user"></i>
icon at the top right of the DSM and pick “Account” and then
either “2-Factor Authentication” or “Passwordless Sign-In”.</p>

<p>Download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.securesignin&amp;pli=1">Synology Secure SignIn</a>
app or use one you already have like Google Authenticator.</p>

<p>Some other interesting options there:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Others &gt; Resume DSM to my previous logout status when signed in</li>
  <li>Display Preferences &gt; Date Format: because MM/dd/YYYY is just plain weird 😉</li>
  <li>Account &gt; Change Password: Synology will not accept your <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">44 bits of entropy</a> password
    <ul>
      <li>Control Panel &gt; User &amp; Group &gt; Advanced &gt; Apply password strength rules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ssh">SSH</h2>

<p>First, activate your <code>~/</code> home:<br />
Control Panel &gt; File Sharing &gt; User &amp; Group &gt; Advanced &gt; User Home &gt; Enable user home service</p>

<p>Then, enable SSH:<br />
Control Panel &gt; Terminal &amp; SNMP &gt; Terminal &gt; Enable SSH Service</p>

<p>If you keep the default port 22 and make it externally available,
expect a LOT of login attempt notifications from script kiddies.<br />
You may want to pick a random port instead! Which has it’s
<a href="https://serverfault.com/a/619945">own problems</a>.</p>

<p>You may also want to look at Auto Block settings at<br />
Control Panel &gt; Connectivity &gt; Security &gt; Protection</p>

<p>You can now login with your password:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">ssh 192.168.1.x -p 22 -luserName
</code></pre>

<p>If this fails with error: “unable to start ssh-agent service, error :1058”:</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
</code></pre>

<p>Or start in <code>services.msc</code>: OpenSSH Authentication Agent</p>

<h3 id="rsa-key-pairs">RSA Key Pairs</h3>

<p>Who wants to type that password all the time…</p>

<p>On your Windows (!?) machine:</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">ssh-keygen

# You could also use DSM to upload the pub file...
cd $env:userprofile/.ssh
scp -P 22 -r ./id_rsa.pub userName@192.168.1.x:~/
</code></pre>

<p>On your NAS:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">mkdir ~/.ssh
cat ~/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
rm ~/id_rsa.pub

chmod 755 ~/
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

sudo sed -i '/^#PubkeyAuthentication yes/s/^#//' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo synosystemctl restart sshd.service
</code></pre>

<p>Check out <a href="https://blog.aaronlenoir.com/2018/05/06/ssh-into-synology-nas-with-ssh-key/">this blog post</a>
for more details.</p>

<h3 id="oh-my-bash">Oh My Bash!</h3>

<p>The out of the box ssh experience of Synology is ok.
But we can do better…</p>

<p>This basically involves configuring a <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>

<p>I opted for <a href="https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash">Oh My Bash</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/master/tools/install.sh)"
</code></pre>

<p>If you have forked the Oh My Bash repository:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/.oh-my-bash
git remote add mine https://github.com/Laoujin/oh-my-bash
git fetch mine
git branch -u mine/master
git pull
</code></pre>

<p>This created said <code>~/.bashrc</code> which you will want to configure!</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>OSH_THEME</code>: Pick a folder name in <code>themes</code></li>
  <li><code>completions</code>: Tab autocomplete? Yes please!</li>
  <li><code>aliases</code>: You get <code>...</code> as <code>cd ../../</code> out of the box but there are many more.</li>
  <li><code>plugins</code>: bashmarks (=jump to location) is really cool! Run <code>bm</code> for help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use <code>bash -l</code> to reload your shell after having made changes.</p>

<!--

<h2 id="package-center">Package Center</h2>

<p>You probably want to install these packages.
From the UI because <code>synopkg</code> doesn’t seem
to provide a way to install an official
package 😭</p>

<ul>
  <li>Text Editor</li>
  <li>Git Server</li>
  <li>Docker</li>
  <li>Cloud Sync (Dropbox, GDrive, …)</li>
</ul>

<p>After that I basically do everything with Docker
but if you want some ready-made packages that
are not in the official listing, be sure to
checkout <a href="https://synocommunity.com/">SynoCommunity</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-sync">Cloud Sync</h3>

<p>I created a <code>/volume1/Dropbox</code> shared folder for Dropbox:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo synoshare --help
sudo synoshare --add Dropbox "Dropbox Cloud Sync" /volume1/Dropbox "" "users" "" 0 0
</code></pre>

<h3 id="git">Git</h3>

<h4 id="configuration">Configuration</h4>

<pre><code class="language-sh">git config --global user.name ""
git config --global user.email ""

# And then I copy my ".common.gitconfig" file:
# https://github.com/Laoujin/dotfiles/blob/master/config/git/.common.gitconfig
# Windows
scp -P 22 -r ~/.common.gitconfig userName@192.168.1.x:~/

# NAS
git config --global include.path "~/.common.gitconfig"

# Overwrite your Windows autocrlf=true:
git config --global core.autocrlf false
</code></pre>

<p>You could also opt to create a symbolic link from your Cloud Sync <code>.gitconfig</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">ln -s /volume1/Dropbox/.common.gitconfig ~/.common.gitconfig
git config --global include.path "~/.common.gitconfig"
</code></pre>

<h4 id="github">Github</h4>

<p>For private repos and pushing stuff:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh"># On NAS this time!
ssh-keygen
</code></pre>

<p>Add the SSH Authentication key in <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys">Github Settings</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New SSH key</li>
  <li>Paste the <code>.pub</code> file</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>

<p>To avoid having to <code>sudo docker</code> everything.</p>

<p>We started the bootcamp with a short introduction to “Game Graphics Production”
followed by a Unreal Engine 101 where Tom also let us in on the game industry’s biggest
secret: fake it!</p>

<p>Don’t create 6 different versions of something. Create just the one and then copy/paste, rotate,
enlarge, play with lighting, materials and no one will notice they are looking at the same thing
copied over and over!</p>

<p>As true developers this was easily accepted, and so we got to work!</p>

make it all look even better by playing with light, fog, elevations and finish up the landscape
with terrain and foliage assets.</p>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>The next iteration of the itenium Security Bootcamp is at the <a href="https://www.mitechcon.org/">Michigan Technology Conference 2024</a>. Its vulnerable applications will be running for the duration of the conference: exploit the vulnerabilities (hack!?) and submit captured flags in the Portal website.</p>

<p>Here is how those that will participate can prepare themselves.</p>

<p>If the term <code>SQL Injection</code> does not ring a bell, you may want to start by reading up on
that and other vulnerabilities such as: XSS, CSRF, OWASP, …</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p><strong>Super Tips</strong>:<br />
Statements in this blog that have a 😉 emoji, ignore at your own peril 😉</p>

<h2 id="api-key">API Key</h2>

<p><strong>GUARD YOUR API KEY WITH YOUR LIFE</strong></p>

<p>Your API key is how the game keeps track of your progress.<br />
The API key is required to login and to submit captured flags (=score points).</p>

<p>You should have received yours by email.<br />
If you do not have an API key, contact one of the game admins.</p>]]></block1>

<p><strong>Divide &amp; Conquer</strong></p>

<p>It’s possible to play in a team!</p>

<h2 id="start-playing">Start Playing</h2>

<p>At the start of the conference we will communicate how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connect to our network</li>
  <li>The URL of the Portal</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve reached the Portal, you can login with your API key
which will generate a JWT token used for authentication.</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-stage">Setting The Stage</h2>

<p><strong>BREAKING NEWS</strong>:
All MITechCon sessions STOLEN, mere days before the conference start!</p>

<p>It is assumed that <strong>Alexander Cipher</strong> from <strong>ACME Coding Con</strong> is behind
the theft of the priceless <code>mitechcon-2024-sessions.zip</code> (probably because they
had insufficient material of their own).</p>

<p>But don’t panic just yet, there is hope still: our hacker liaison discovered ACME Coding Con has scheduled a major portal migration on thursday 21 March. We managed to secure migration API keys, which will enable us to infiltrate their portal and, with some clever hacking, retrieve our beloved zip.</p>

<h2 id="your-tools">Your Tools</h2>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p><strong>Bring your own ethernet cable and make sure your laptop has an ethernet port!</strong></p>

<p>You do not want to perform a brute force attack on wifi, trust us.</p>

<h4 id="chrome-dev-tools">Chrome Dev Tools</h4>

<p>Open Dev Tools with <strong>F12</strong>.<br />
The following tabs will be interesting for the bootcamp:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Application</strong> &gt; “Local Storage”
    <ul>
      <li>token: Your JWT token</li>
      <li>user: Your details</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Network</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Many hacks are performed by doing a Http request.</li>
      <li>The flag is typically in the Response of such request!</li>
      <li>Interesting options
        <ul>
          <li>Fetch/XHR: this is what we’re interested in</li>
          <li>Preserve log: do not purge the list when the page is refreshed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Interesting request details
        <ul>
          <li>Headers &gt; Request Url: to see query string arguments</li>
          <li>Payload: the body sent with the request</li>
          <li>Response: the reply from the server</li>

  <li>Console
    <ul>
      <li>Interesting logs or errors may show up here</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You could also monitor network traffic with a tool like
<a href="https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler-everywhere">Fiddler</a>
or <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html">Wireshark</a></p>

<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>

<h3 id="the-portal">The Portal</h3>

<p>If you are unsure how to get started</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explore The Portal website
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure to update your settings after logging in 😉</li>
      <li>Visit the “Hacks Overview” page from the portal for extra tips</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run an <code>nmap</code> scan on the server the Portal is served from to discover more</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-game-blogs">In-Game Blogs</h3>

<p>As part of the Security Bootcamp, two (vulnerable) Wordpress
blogs are spun up, visit them from the Portal for more useful information:</p>

<p><strong>The Hacker’s Toolkit Blog</strong> contains posts on hacking tools and general info on JWT, Capturing Flags and more</p>

<p><strong>The Security Audit Blog</strong> contains clues for the treasure hunts.</p>

<h3 id="the-flags">The Flags</h3>

<p>Just performing a certain hack does not score points,
you have to locate the flag that is revealed by the hack.</p>

<p>Make sure to check the response body after you have performed a hack 😉</p>

<p>The following case-sensitive regex will match a flag:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">[A-Z]{2,5}-[a-zA-Z0-9. -]{4,50}
</code></pre>

<p>Other things that score points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The API key of another player not in your team</li>
  <li>The JWT token of another player not in your team</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the blog post in The Hacker’s Toolkit Blog in-game for more info!</p>

<h3 id="the-vault">The Vault</h3>

<p>The Vault is where Alexander Cipher has hidden our precious zip. 
It is the end game and will open on friday 22 March at 11AM.<br />
But you can continue playing until friday 22 March at 5PM, when the winners
will be announced.</p>

<p>Many of the flags found in the game are somehow encrypted
with <a href="https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/">simple ciphers</a>.</p>

<p>Attempt to open the Vault by entering all your decrypted flags
as passphrase and score Vault multipliers.</p>

<p>Beware, incorrectly decrypted flags will cost points!</p>

  Assert.That(12, Is.Not.EqualTo(24));
  Assert.That("Hello world", Is.Not.Null);

// Both NUnit &amp; TUnit can also use block scoped using
using var _ = Assert.Multiple();
await Assert.That(12).IsNotEqualTo(24);
await Assert.That("Hello world").IsNotNull();

  <p>Angular 17 has landed with a rebranding, and an <a href="https://angular.dev/">a new documentation home</a> which now also offers an interactive learning experience, but what else is new?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a plethora of improvements such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hydration graduated from developer preview</li>
  <li>standalone APIs is now the default</li>
  <li>new @angular/ssr package</li>
  <li>improved SSR functionality</li>
  <li>the Signals API is mostly out of developer preview (effect() remains in it)</li>
  <li>new <code>afterRender</code> and <code>afterNextRender</code> lifecycle hooks</li>
  <li>Vite &amp; esbuild are now the default for new projects</li>
  <li>experimental view transition support</li>
  <li>automatic preconnect in the image directive</li>
  <li>defer loading of the animations module</li>
  <li>style and styleUrls as strings</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>and so much more as you can see in <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1700-2023-11-08">the release notes</a>.<br />
But I’d like to dive into some that offer quite the Quality of Life improvements</p>

<h2 id="built-in-control-flow">Built-in control flow</h2>

<p>Before Angular 17 we’ve always used <code>*ngIf, *ngSwitch, and *ngFor</code>, but now there’s a new block template syntax in preview which feels a lot more intuitive, requires no special imports and has better type checking thanks to its improved type narrowing.</p>

<p>You can automatically migrate existing project with <code>ng generate @angular/core:control-flow</code></p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="ifelse-and-even-else-if">If/else and even else if!</h3>

<p>Traditionally we’d do</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div *ngIf="usingLatest; else outdated"&gt;
   You’re using the latest version. 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;ng-template #outdated&gt;
   You are using an outdated version 
&lt;/ng-template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can do</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">@if (usingLatest) {
  Thank you for using the latest version
} @else {
  You are using an outdated version
}
</code></pre>

<p>This construction also allows us to write an if/else if/else construction which formerly wasn’t possible.</p>

<h3 id="iteration">Iteration</h3>

<p>To loop over a list of elements we’d perform</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div *ngFor="let angularRelease of angularReleases"&gt;
  Release: {{ angularRelease.versionNumber }} - Date: {{ angularRelease.date }} &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With <strong>optionally</strong> a <code>trackBy</code> function. In the new approach, <code>track</code> is mandatory. The new for statement uses a new diffing algorithm which is quite a bit faster according to <a href="https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html"><strong>community framework benchmarks</strong></a>.<br />
It’s also quite easy to add an empty placeholder.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">@for (angularRelease of angularReleases; track angularRelease.versionNumber) {
  Release: {{ angularRelease.versionNumber }} - Date: {{ angularRelease.date }} &lt;br&gt;
} @empty {
  Empty list of releases
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="switches">Switches</h3>

<p>Switches have also become quite a lot more convenient, from:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div [ngSwitch]="roll"&gt;
  &lt;app-one *ngSwitchCase="1"/&gt;
  &lt;app-two *ngSwitchCase="2"/&gt;
  &lt;app-three *ngSwitchDefault/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">@switch (roll) {
  @case (1) { &lt;app-one/&gt; }
  @case (2) { &lt;app-two/&gt; }
  @default { &lt;app-three/&gt; }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="deferrable-views">Deferrable views</h2>

<p>This is the planned roads forwards for lazy loading. It utilizes the new block mechanism for <strong>standalone</strong> components to make our applications faster, by as the name implies easily facilitating declarative, deferred loading. One of the nice things about this, is that this all also happens at compile-time, all the complexity is abstracted away.</p>

<p>Let’s use this example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">@defer (on hover) {
  &lt;app-heavy/&gt;
} @loading {
  Loading…
} @error {
  Loading failed
} @placeholder (minimum 2000ms) {
  &lt;div&gt;Placeholder that will be shown for 2000ms minimally (to prevent flickering in case the deferred component loads quickly)&lt;/div&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we’re deferring the loading of a heavy component, until the block’s been hovered over. In the interim we’ll be showcasing the placeholder (and in this case, minimally for 2 seconds). After which we’ll see either the loading in case it takes long/the result/loading failed in case of an error.</p>

<p>Only <code>@defer</code> is required, <code>@loading | @error | @placeholder</code> are all optional.</p>

<p>There possible triggers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on idle =&gt; there default, triggers loading once the browser has reached an idle state</li>
  <li>on viewport =&gt; when the specified content enters the viewport</li>
  <li>on hover =&gt; when the user hovers over the trigger area</li>
  <li>on interact =&gt; when the user interacts with the specified element</li>
  <li>on immediate =&gt; triggered once the client has finished rendering</li>
  <li>on timer =&gt; delays the loading with a timer</li>
</ul>

<p>Another nice thing is that deferrable views also allow us the option to prefetch dependencies before rendering them. This can be done by adding a <code>prefetch</code> to the defer block (the same triggers as above are supported).</p>

<p><code>@defer (on viewport; prefetch on idle) {...}</code></p>]]></block2>

      <block1><![CDATA[<p>In this book, which is the start of a new series we dive into the world of tidyings which are small changes that do not alter the behaviour of our applications.
These are similar to refactorings, but smaller in scope and impact, or as described in the book “cute, fuzzy little refactorings that nobody could possibly hate on”.</p>

<p>The “?” in the title is certainly not an error, it’s not a how-to book but it offers us premises to makes us think and his insights are shared to help us define a framework.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="about-the-book">About the book</h3>

<p>This book is the start of a new series, and we start with tidying which he calls “the Pringles of software design” to facilitate future (behavioural) changes.</p>

<p>It is split into 3 sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Tidyings</em> what are they?</li>
  <li><em>Managing</em> if &amp; when do them?</li>
  <li><em>Theory</em>: why should we do it?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tidyings">Tidyings</h3>

<p>Here Beck starts us of with some sample tidyings that make behavioural changes (features) in the future easier.<br />
These small, easily reversible changes that do not need to be preemptively approved, and increase our enjoyment and productivity while coding.</p>

<p>We’re walked through 15 examples, some of which may seem quite obvious but it never hurts to think about them, and what they actually mean.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reading order</li>
  <li>extract helpers</li>
  <li>new interface, old implementation</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="managing">Managing</h3>

<p>Here we dive into the more ephemeral question of: should we tidy up, and if so: when?</p>

<p>Like everyone else (hopefully), I like seeing clean code. But as the saying goes “beauty is in the eye of the beholder”.<br />
There is only so much time we can spend on tidying, since after all we also need to focus on the added value.</p>

<p>Ken Beck is not dogmatic in his opinion, and approaches these questions from a trade-off point of view and gives us possible approaches.</p>

<p>He provides us with insights to help us think about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when to tidy: before behavior changes, after behavioral changes, later, or never</li>
  <li>when to stop tidying</li>
  <li>whether or not to combine structural changes and behavioral changes</li>
  <li>when and how to batch</li>
</ul>

<p>And as always align with your team.</p>

<h3 id="theory">Theory</h3>

<p>This was my favourite section. We’ve dived into the what &amp; when, but what’s the why? Which is certainly a question one can expect when tidying.<br />
Often there can be certain challenges if one cannot properly convey the reasoning for this activity, after all why are you doing this?<br />
What’s the value for the product owner?</p>

<p>And here’s where we dive into metaphors from the financial market &amp; option trading to help explain the different offered forms of value:</p>

<ul>
  <li>optionality</li>
  <li>time/value of money</li>
  <li>coupling &amp; cohesion</li>
  <li>capability of dealing with uncertainty and change</li>
  <li>reversible changes</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>He does a magnificent job of clearly conveying these concepts, which helps us bridge certain gaps.</p>

<h2 id="my-thoughts">My thoughts</h2>

<p>The book contains some very useful insights, and the small bite-sized sections made it an enjoyable, educative read whilst sipping some tea.</p>

<p>While the “what” section might contain a lot of “obvious” things, a refresher never hurts and they are always approached from multiple angles.<br />
This also makes it an easier recommendation, compared to certain more opinionated books.</p>

<p>The “when” &amp; “why” section are where the real meat was for me.<br />
In the finalle Ken put a lot of effort into the value (or lack thereof) of doing these changes and gives insights into bridging certain gaps/phrasing towards business-owners to discuss the buy-in.</p>]]></block2>

<p>In the ever-evolving world of technology, the <strong>European Women in Tech</strong> in Amsterdam shed light on some crucial insights and perspectives. From the wise words of Elisabeth Theophille, who emphasized the importance of embracing change and enjoying the journey, to the valuable lessons learned from industry leaders like Heineken, Ikea, and ING, the event provided a unique opportunity to explore the complexities of digital transformation and AI.</p>

<p>This blog post delves into the key takeaways from the event, highlighting the importance of responsible AI, organizational transformation, the role of data-driven decision-making, and Ikea’s contribution to the realm of Explainable AI.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-gender-gap-in-tech">The Gender Gap in Tech</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-theophille-1224244">Elisabeth Theophille</a>, Chief technology transformation officer at Novartis, opened the event by addressing the gender gap in the tech industry, emphasizing that only 24% of tech professionals worldwide are women. Despite the challenges, she encouraged women to embrace change and enjoy the journey of growth, highlighting the importance of finding comfort in discomfort. In a world where diversity and inclusion are becoming increasingly vital, her message resonated with many.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="heinekens-transformation-journey">Heineken’s Transformation Journey</h2>

<p>Heineken shared insights into their transformation journey, emphasizing that digital transformation is not about productivity but about seizing new business opportunities. They acknowledged the high risk of failure but stressed the importance of learning fast and adapting even faster. Their three focus areas—focussing on customer value, empowering employees, and unlocking data—were key drivers of their success. They also highlighted the significance of attracting and retaining talent in the tech industry by offering creative solutions and fostering new skills.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-tech-in-non-tech-businesses">Implementing Tech in Non-Tech Businesses</h3>

<p>Heineken’s experience demonstrated that tech transformation is not limited to tech companies. Even non-tech businesses can benefit from these strategies. Their “evergreen” strategy, focused on becoming the best-connected brewer, showcased the importance of adapting to new technologies and trends continuously.</p>

<p>Heineken’s journey taught us that transformation is an ongoing process that requires growth and adaptation. To outcompete in the digital age, organizations must not only embrace technology but also foster a culture of learning, innovation, and inclusivity.</p>

<h2 id="explainable-ai-at-ikea">Explainable AI at Ikea</h2>

<p>Ikea, a prominent name in the world of retail and home furnishings, also contributed to the discussions at the event. They highlighted the significance of Explainable AI. This concept revolves around ensuring that AI systems are transparent and can provide clear explanations for their decisions and actions. In an era where AI is increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives, the ability to understand and trust AI-driven decisions is paramount.</p>

<h2 id="data-driven-decision-making">Data-Driven Decision-Making</h2>

<p>The event also touched upon the importance of data-driven decision-making. The value of data lies in the actions it enables. Trust is at the core of data-driven decision-making. Understanding why and how data is used is crucial, and data quality is paramount.</p>

<h3 id="the-three-rois-of-data-driven-decision-making">The Three ROIs of Data-Driven Decision-Making</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reducing Costs</strong>: Data-driven insights can identify areas where costs can be reduced.</li>
  <li><strong>Increasing ROI</strong>: Data can uncover opportunities to enhance returns on investment.</li>
  <li><strong>Saving Time</strong>: Data-driven decision-making streamlines processes and saves time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="organizational-models-for-data-teams">Organizational Models for Data Teams</h3>

button. Or use “<i class="fa fa-refresh" style="color: #59616C"></i> : Reload page and start profiling” when it’s your
initial page load that is taking too long.</p>

<p>The default “<i class="fa fa-fire" style="color: #0086FC"></i> : Flamegraph chart” display
is perfect as long as the next performance issues are easy to pick out.</p>

    <figcaption>So what is this 'InvoiceWorkedDays' component?</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<h2 id="easy-pickings">Easy Pickings</h2>

<p>⏱️ 6 seconds for 100 invoices/rows.</p>

<p>The first three profiling rounds revealed that the biggest issues were in non-component code:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Third Party Packages</strong>: Do not assume that free, open-source, packages will be performant.</li>
  <li><strong>Nested Loops</strong>: Several inner loops caused a significant CPU-bound delay.</li>
  <li><strong>Frequent I/O</strong>: <code>sessionStorage</code> was being accessed for each component wrapped in a role check.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="culprit-1-third-party-package">Culprit 1: Third Party Package</h3>

<p><code>InvoiceWorkedDays</code>, the component in confac that was causing all this fuzz:</p>

<figure class="imagewrapper" style="max-width: 650px">
    <img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/rcp-confac-invoice-list.png" alt="" title="" class="img-responsive" />

    
    <figcaption>An entire second spent on displaying an amount of days</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The part that was eating up all this time was <a href="https://github.com/commenthol/date-holidays"><code>date-holidays</code></a>,
an npm package used to calculate the official Belgian holidays.</p>

<p>The date-holidays can calculate holidays for Chinese, Korean and every other calendar out in existence.
Because of the un-tree-shakable initialization <code>const hd = new Holidays('BE');</code> all the code for those
calendars were also being parsed.
Sub-dependencies included <a href="https://github.com/commenthol/astronomia"><code>astronomia</code></a>,
leading to a footprint of about 10MB.</p>

<p>We have since replaced the dependency with our own, dedicated (76 liner), npm package
<a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/date-holidays-be"><code>@itenium/date-holidays-be</code></a>.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="culprit-2-nested-loops-cpu">Culprit 2: Nested Loops (CPU)</h3>

<figure class="imagewrapper" style="max-width: 650px">
    <img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/rcp-profiler-flamegraph-InvoiceDownloadIcon.png" alt="" title="" class="img-responsive" />

    
    <figcaption>Another unexpected performance optimalization target: the InvoiceDownloadIcon</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// InvoiceDownloadIcon
const fullProjectMonth = useProjectMonthFromInvoice(invoice._id);
</code></pre>

<p>This custom Hook would first make a <code>FullProjectMonth</code> of all ‘projectMonth’ records
in the Redux store and then pick the one with <code>invoice._id</code>.</p>

<p>Problem here was, that to resolve a “projectMonth”, 5 other collections needed to be
traversed as well. As the data grew, time spent here grew considerably.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// fn mapToProjectMonth
const project = confacState.projects.find(p =&gt; p._id === projectMonth.projectId);
const consultant = confacState.consultants.find(c =&gt; c._id === project.consultantId);
const client = confacState.clients.find(c =&gt; c._id === project.client.clientId);
const partner = confacState.clients.find(c =&gt; project.partner &amp;&amp; c._id === project.partner.clientId);
const invoice = confacState.invoices.find(i =&gt; i.projectMonth &amp;&amp; i.projectMonth.projectMonthId === projectMonth._id);
</code></pre>

<p>We can greatly optimize this by first filtering on <code>invoice._id</code> so the 5 inner loops are executed just once!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="culprit-3-io-sessionstorage">Culprit 3: I/O (sessionStorage)</h3>

<p>⏱️ 2 seconds for 100 invoices/rows.</p>

<figure class="imagewrapper" style="max-width: 628px">
    <img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/rcp-profiler-flamegraph-WithClaim.png" alt="" title="" class="img-responsive" />

    
    <figcaption>And now the WithClaim decorator??? What is happening there...</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>It’s starting to become difficult to discern the next performance culprit.
The second profiler display method
“<i class="fa fa-sort-amount-desc" style="color: #0086FC"></i> : Ranked chart” to the rescue!</p>

<figure class="imagewrapper" style="max-width: 650px">
    <img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/rcp-profiler-WithClaim-ranked-graph.png" alt="" title="" class="img-responsive" />

    
    <figcaption>Profiler Ranked chart display</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<h5 id="the-code">The Code</h5>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// The decorator
export const EnhanceWithClaim = &lt;P extends object&gt;(Component: React.ComponentType&lt;P&gt;) =&gt;
  class WithClaim extends React.Component&lt;P &amp; EnhanceWithClaimProps&gt; {
    render() {
      const {claim, ...props} = this.props;
      if (claim) {
        const claims: string[] = authService.getClaims();
        if (!claims.includes(claim)) {
          return null;
        }
      }
      return &lt;Component {...props as P} /&gt;;
    }
  };

// Wrap a component
const LinkWithClaim = EnhanceWithClaim(Link);

// Usage
const CreateInvoiceLink = () =&gt; (
  &lt;LinkWithClaim claim="invoice-create" to="/invoices/create"&gt;
    Create Invoice
  &lt;/LinkWithClaim&gt;
)
</code></pre>

<p>The culprit here turned out to be <code>authService.getClaims()</code>,
which ended up doing the following for every of the hundreds
of icons, buttons etc displayed.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// I/O being executed many, many times == performance impact!
const token = sessionStorage.getItem('jwt');
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>

<p>When you are rendering a grid with thousands of rows,
you’ll always going to end up with a performance problem (at some point).</p>

<p>There are several mitigations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pagination</strong> <i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #AFE1AF"></i> Implemented!</li>
  <li><strong>Partial data load</strong> <small>(only load last year worth of data in memory at startup)</small> <i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #AFE1AF"></i> Implemented!</li>
  <li><strong>Debouncing</strong>: Useful when filtering the grids, only start a re-render when the user is done entering the filter criteria</li>
  <li><strong>Virtualization &amp; Infinite Scroll</strong>: A grid can display an “infinite” amount of rows and still be performant!</li>
  <li><strong>Suspense &amp; useDeferredValue</strong>: Not relevant here because all data is already in memory</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>⏱️ 360 ms for 100 invoices/rows.</p>

<p>These were the “easy pickings”, where the profiler’s flamegraph gave it to us straight.
This greatly improved performance (6s -&gt; 360ms) which is good enough.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not doing a calculation or render is the best optimalization</li>
  <li>Keep an eye on 3rd party packages</li>
  <li>I/O operations are expensive</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-meaty-part">The Meaty Part</h2>

<p>There is another screen and performance there is… disastrous.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is re-rendered whenever a projectMonth gets collapsed/opened.
    <ul>
      <li>Opening more and more projectMonths gets slower and slower.</li>
      <li>⏱️ 2 open projectMonths: 350ms</li>
      <li>⏱️ 4 open projectMonths: 1.2s</li>
      <li>⏱️ 18 open projectMonths: 5s</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Filters are remembered between route changes.
    <ul>
      <li>Navigating back can be painfully slow when many projectMonths were open.</li>
      <li>⏱️ With 18 open projectMonths: 4.4s</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <figcaption>The projectMonths screen -- open up more months and you can go get a coffee in between renders 😢</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="belgian-holidays-cache">Belgian Holidays Cache</h3>

<p>For this workshop, <code>date-holidays</code> was not replaced with a more dedicated and efficient alternative.
Instead we’re using it as a placeholder for something that would actually take a long time
and cannot be so easily improved.</p>

<p>To get to the following flamegraph, we added a simple cache for the <code>date-holidays</code> dependency.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">const workDaysInMonthCache: {[month: string]: number} = {};
</code></pre>

<figure class="imagewrapper" style="max-width: 650px">
    <img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/rcp-profiler-flamegraph-projectMonths.png" alt="" title="" class="img-responsive" />

    
    <figcaption>A more even distribution now... So no easy performance targets</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<h3 id="avoiding-ifeature-construction">Avoiding IFeature Construction</h3>

<p>The <code>IFeature</code> configures a grid and CRUD pages for a backend entity.</p>

<p>It contains the data and currently active filters. The problem here
is that the <code>openMonths: string[]</code> filter is also part of the data
of the <code>IFeature</code>.</p>

<p>Because of how Redux works, the <code>openMonths: string[]</code> filter becomes a new
array reference each time a projectMonth is opened/collapsed. This causes
all months to be re-rendered instead of just the one being toggled
because the filters object has changed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the expensive <code>IFeature</code> construction is not necessary
when the projectMonth is collapsed. Instead we can map directly to
<code>CollapsedProjectMonthBadgeTotals</code>, which doesn’t include any inner loops.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">export const ProjectMonthsList = ({feature, month}: ProjectMonthsListProps) =&gt; {
  // If this isn't a Demeter violation, I don't know what is 😓
  if (feature.list.filter.state.openMonths.includes(month)) {
    return (

    );
  }

  // When the ProjectMonth is collapsed, we don't
  // really need to construct the IFeature...
  return &lt;ProjectMonthListCollapsed feature={feature} /&gt;;
};
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="introducing-reselect">Introducing: Reselect</h3>

<p>A library for creating <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect">memoized “selector” functions</a>.
Commonly used with Redux and comes with the <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">@reduxjs/toolkit</a>.</p>

<p>Caching the expensive mapping to <code>FullProjectMonthModels</code> &amp; <code>CollapsedProjectMonthBadgeTotals</code>
with <code>createSelector</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// Create the selector
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

export const createFullProjectMonthsSelector = () =&gt; createSelector(
  // Select required store data
  // Re-renders happen when these references change
  (state: ConfacState) =&gt; state.projectsMonth,
  (state: ConfacState) =&gt; state.projects,
  (state: ConfacState) =&gt; state.consultants,

  // Introduce a "month" parameter for the selector
  (_, month: string) =&gt; month,

  // The actual mapping
  (projectsMonth, projects, consultants, month) =&gt; {
    const context = { projectsMonth, projects, consultants }
    return projectsMonth
      .filter(x =&gt; isSameMonth(x.month, month))
      .map(x =&gt; mapToProjectMonth(context, x));
  },

  // Optional configuration
  {
    memoizeOptions: {
      equalityCheck: (a, b) =&gt; a === b, // ex: use deep-equal instead
      maxSize: 10, // selector cache
      // import { shallowEqual } from 'react-redux';
      resultEqualityCheck: shallowEqual
    }
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="introducing-usememo">Introducing: useMemo</h3>

<p>Skip expensive recalculations with <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo"><code>useMemo</code></a></p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">useMemo(calculateValue, dependencies)
</code></pre>

<p>We now need to cache the <code>createFullProjectMonthsSelector</code> mapped data
for each month. Because we want to keep a memoized version of each month,
we pass an empty array as the dependencies argument to useMemo.</p>

<p>If you need to cache only until the month changes, as in when you are
navigating from one detail page to another, the dependencies would become
<code>[month]</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">// Selector usage
import { useMemo } from 'react';

export const OpenedProjectMonthsList = ({ month }: OpenedProjectMonthsListProps) =&gt; {
  // Use the createSelector as defined above
  // With empty array as dependencies argument
  const selectProjectMonths = useMemo(createFullProjectMonthsSelector, []);

  // Use the memoized selector
  const projectMonths = useSelector(state =&gt; selectProjectMonths(state, month));

  // And construct the IFeature
  return &lt;List feature={projectMonthFeature(projectMonths)} /&gt;;
};
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="introducing-memo">Introducing: memo</h3>

<p>When a <code>ProjectMonthListCollapsed</code> is rendered, its details don’t change,
so we can do some aggressive caching there, keeping the entire rendered
component in the cache with <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/memo"><code>React.memo(component, propsAreEqual?)</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { memo } from 'react';

// Memoize the component for each value of month
const ProjectMonthListCollapsedMemo = memo(({ month }) =&gt; {
  return &lt;ProjectMonthListCollapsed month={month} /&gt;;
});


export const OpenOrClosedProjectMonthsList = ({ month }) =&gt; {
  const isOpen = useSelector(state =&gt; state.filters.projectMonths.openMonths[month]);
  if (isOpen) {
    return &lt;OpenedProjectMonthsList month={month} /&gt;;
  }
  return &lt;ProjectMonthListCollapsedMemo month={month} /&gt;;
};
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="the-aftermath">The Aftermath</h3>

<figure class="imagewrapper" style="max-width: 650px">
    <img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/rcp-profiler-projectMonths-final.png" alt="" title="" class="img-responsive" />

    
    <figcaption>Flamegraph after opening a second projectMonth</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>No re-render of the previously opened projectMonth (reselect &amp; useMemo)</li>
  <li>The render of the newly opened projectMonth</li>
  <li>The completely cached collapsed/closed projectMonths (memo)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="conclusions-1">Conclusions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>⏱️ 2 projectMonths: 350ms -&gt; 170ms</li>
  <li>⏱️ 4 projectMonths: 1.2s -&gt; 311ms</li>
  <li>⏱️ 18 open projectMonths: 5s -&gt; 140ms</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest win was avoiding the re-renders of all projectMonths
when opening/closing just one and caching expensive Redux selects.</p>

<h4 id="take-aways">Take-Aways</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Depend on as little as possible
    <ul>
      <li>Components should rely on their minimum requirements of state and props only</li>
      <li>Prefer props only for low level components</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cache expensive calculations</li>
  <li>createSelector, useMemo and memo are your friends</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="the-ifeature">The IFeature</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.”</em>
— Fred Brooks</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="unexpected-side-effect">Unexpected Side-Effect</h4>

<p>The overall structure and code quality has improved due the refactorings
needed to realize the performance targets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>More components with finer grained purpose resulted in a clearer component hierarchy</li>
  <li>Complexity has increased but it is hidden away in hooks and selectors</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="profiler-alternatives">Profiler Alternatives</h2>

<p>If the Chrome Profiler Extension isn’t cutting it for you anymore,
you can still fallback to these alternatives for locating
performance optimalization targets.</p>

<h3 id="consoletime">console.time</h3>

<p>Good old <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/timeEnd">console</a> 😉</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">console.time('timer1')

const result = expensiveOp1()
console.timeLog('timer1', 'result is', result)
expensiveOp2()

console.timeEnd('timer1')
</code></pre>

<h3 id="profiler-component">Profiler Component</h3>

<p><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/Profiler"><code>&lt;Profiler /&gt;</code></a> doesn’t actually render anything
and can be nested by providing different ids.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { Profiler } from 'react';

function callback(
  id, // the "id" prop of the Profiler tree that has just committed
  phase, // either "mount" (if the tree just mounted) or "update" (if it re-rendered)
  actualDuration, // time spent rendering the committed update
  baseDuration, // estimated time to render the entire subtree without memoization
  startTime, // when React began rendering this update
  commitTime, // when React committed this update
  interactions // the Set of interactions belonging to this update
) {
  console.log(`${id}: ${phase} in ${actualDuration}`);
}

const LongRendering = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Profiler id="uniqueId" onRender={callback}&gt;
    &lt;LongRenderingItem /&gt;
  &lt;/Profiler&gt;
)
</code></pre>

<p>For a simple case like this with only one <code>&lt;Profiler</code>, you are better off just using
the Chrome extension.</p>

<p>It can come in handy for micro optimizations, using multiple <code>&lt;Profiler /&gt;</code>s
and hundreds/thousands of components. At that point you will need to write your
own aggregator in the callback to make some sense of the data.</p>

<p>A simple aggregator on <code>ID</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">type ITiming = {
  renders: number;
  totalTime: number;
  averageTime?: number;
}

const timings: {[key: string]: ITiming} = {}

function callback(id, phase, actualDuration) {
  if (!timings[id]) {
    timings[id] = {renders: 1, totalTime: actualDuration};
  } else {
    const oldTimings = timings[id];
    timings[id] = {
      renders: oldTimings.renders + 1,
      totalTime: oldTimings.totalTime + actualDuration
    };
  }

  timings[id].averageTime = timings[id].totalTime / timings[id].renders;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="further-optimalizations">Further Optimalizations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid inline styles</li>
  <li><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback"><strong>useCallback</strong></a>: cache event handlers
    <ul>
      <li>Tricky: useCallback also takes time; in my case it actually degraded performance</li>
      <li>As always with perf optimizations –&gt; <strong>MEASURE</strong> (the profiler is your friend)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>memo</strong>: Components without props can be cached entirely</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/React-ComponentProfiling/blob/master/snippets/useWhyDidYouUpdate.ts"><strong>useWhyDidYouUpdate</strong></a>: part of many hooks-libraries (I didn’t find it very useful)</li>
  <li><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useDebugValue"><strong>useDebugValue</strong></a>: to be used in custom hooks (more for library developers IMO)</li>

equipping them with essential tips and insights for developing secure APIs
and web applications.</p>

<p>Your testers learn how to perform fundamental security tests to ensure
no unauthorized data access or manipulation is possible by crafting
custom requests.</p>

<p>Our presentations also serve as eye-openers for product owners and managers,
shedding light on the potential catastrophic consequences of these vulnerabilities
and the ease with which they can be exploited, using readily available tools.</p>

<p>To drive the message home, we conclude our presentations with real-world examples,
showcasing how renowned companies and products have fallen victim to these
vulnerabilities time and again, often resulting in significant financial repercussions.</p>

<h3 id="hacking-tools">Hacking Tools</h3>

<p>Participants directly witness the potentially severe repercussions
of vulnerable applications through engaging presentations, in-game blog posts,
and live demonstrations of powerful hacking tools,

    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>A few hours of fun, playing around with Docker, Cron, Node, Shell and a FileServer.
Can ChatGPT do this too? And maybe in less time?</p>

<p>To be honest, I am very biased against ChatGPT but still hoping, very hard, that it can just do this,
so that I can start using it for simple stuff, POCs and more!</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>We’re talking a whole whopping 180 lines of code here, including newlines and comments.
ChatGPT is all the hype, so surely it must be able to write this very very simple app, right?</p>

<h2 id="initial-prompt">Initial Prompt</h2>

<p>Let’s dumb it down a bit, forgetting about Docker, the static file server and the <code>already-sent</code> folder for now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello there ChatGPT. Could you create a program for me that, every friday at 16 hours selects a random image from a directory and sends it to a Slack channel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It created a small Python script with inline configuration for Slack API token and meme directory.
And then suggested using <code>cron</code> or <code>Task Scheduler</code> for the friday 16h part. That’s actually a good
idea, I should add Windows instructions to the installation blog post for non-Docker usage 😃</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>Anyway, let’s try it out!</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">pip install slack-sdk
python 1-InitialPrompt.py
</code></pre>

<p>Well, that didn’t quite work:</p>

<pre><code class="language-py">  File ".\1-InitialPrompt.py", line 26
    print(f"Image sent to Slack channel '{channel}' successfully!")
                                                                 ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>

<p>Uhoh, still using Python 2.7 in 2023, let’s quickly update my <code>$env:PATH</code>.</p>

<p>The full script:</p>

<pre><code class="language-py">import os
import random
import glob
from slack_sdk import WebClient
from slack_sdk.errors import SlackApiError

SLACK_API_TOKEN = "&lt;your-slack-api-token&gt;"
IMAGE_DIRECTORY = "/path/to/your/image/directory"
slack_channel = "#your-channel-name"

slack_client = WebClient(token=SLACK_API_TOKEN)

def send_image_to_slack(channel, file_path):
    try:
        response = slack_client.files_upload(
            channels=channel,
            file=file_path,
            title="Random Image",
        )
        print(f"Image sent to Slack channel '{channel}' successfully!")
    except SlackApiError as e:
        print(f"Failed to send image to Slack channel '{channel}': {e.response['error']}")


image_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIRECTORY, "*.jpg"))
random_image = random.choice(image_files)
send_image_to_slack(slack_channel, random_image)
</code></pre>

<p>The main reason I used the WebHook in the first place because, well getting an API to work…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a warning by replacing <code>slack_client.files_upload</code> to <code>_v2</code> with single channel</li>
  <li>And then a barrage of API errors
    <ul>
      <li>not_allowed_token_type: <code>xapp</code> tokens vs <code>xoxp</code> and <code>xoxb</code> etc</li>
      <li>missing_scope: needed OAuth scopes: <code>files:write</code>, …</li>
      <li>not_in_channel</li>
      <li>channel_not_found: <code>/invite @MemeBot</code> did not solve this nor did <code>chat:write.public</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I was a bit at a loss, the channel most surely exists and I added the bot to it.
So… Let’s ask ChatGPT?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What Slack OAuth scopes do I need to upload a file to a channel using the API?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It gave me some additional scopes but they seemed irrelevant and I indeed got the same error after.</p>

<h2 id="webhook-prompt">WebHook Prompt</h2>

<p>Let’s go back to the WebHook then..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could you generate code using a Slack Webhook instead?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which resulted in code that can actually send a message to Slack.
But not with a picture… It used <code>attachments: []</code> but that doesn’t actually work.
Even if it did, you would still need something to serve the files…</p>

<p>The program:</p>

<pre><code class="language-py">import os
import random
import glob
import requests

SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
IMAGE_DIRECTORY = "./memes"

def send_image_to_slack(webhook_url, file_path):
    try:
        payload = {
            "text": "Random Image",
            "attachments": [
                {
                    "image_url": file_path
                }
            ]
        }
        response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print(f"Image sent to Slack successfully!")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Failed to send image to Slack: {str(e)}")

image_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIRECTORY, "*.jpg"))
random_image = random.choice(image_files)

send_image_to_slack(SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, random_image)
</code></pre>

<p>It did manage to fix this with an additional prompt!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could you generate a Slack Webhook payload with text and an image?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which generated a working payload:</p>

<pre><code>payload = {
    "text": "Random Image",
    "attachments": [
        {
            "fallback": "Image",
            "image_url": file_path
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Progress!! 🎉</p>

<h2 id="file-server">File Server</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you create a docker-compose with a service that executes a Python script with a cron job and a static file server service?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This created</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>docker-compose.yml</code>: Used nginx to create a working static file server</li>
  <li><code>Dockerfile</code>: Took a different approach to what I ended up with</li>
  <li><code>cronjob</code>: It even remembered I wanted to run this on fridays at 16h!</li>
</ul>

<p>It was time to integrate the two solutions. Some manual fixes and additional
prompts later, it had generated something that seemed like it would work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could you replace the python-script.py with the one you generated earlier?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can we bring this all together?<br />
A docker-compose that schedules a cron job that selects a random image from a mounted volume and sends the url as served by an nginx service to Slack using a webhook?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You didn’t include the Python script…<br />
This does not use the docker-compose variables you used in your earlier answer<br />
The dockerfile should do a pip install of requests</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However it did not actually run the cron job… No logs to be found, it just sat there.</p>

<p>Here it seemed I either ran against the limits of ChatGPT or against the limitations
of my “AI Prompt Engineering”-skillz.</p>

<h3 id="backtrack-hello-world">Backtrack: Hello World</h3>

<p>I then tried for over an hour to get ChatGPT to create a docker-compose that
prints “Hello World”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s try again:
Can you create a docker-compose that schedules a cron job to print “Hello World” every minute?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the things it tried:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>crontab</code> file with <code>echo</code></li>
  <li><code>docker-compose</code> with <code>Command</code></li>
  <li><code>startup.sh</code> to print Hello World instead</li>
  <li>…</li>
  <li>Back to a Python script</li>
  <li>The <code>vixiecron</code> package</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I was just copy pasting the code and nothing worked.</p>

<h3 id="being-sassy">Being Sassy</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you think that if I keep asking changes that at some point it will actually work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>… While I do my best to understand and assist with your requests, troubleshooting specific technical issues can be challenging without having direct access to your environment. …</em></p>

<p>And here is me, thinking that the entire philosophy of Docker is to not be dependent on the developer environment.
Oh and I’m also asking for a freaking “Hello World” app here…</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>ChatGPT pretty much gave up after a while and shifted into troubleshooting mode.</p>

<p>It came up with some interesting suggestions, most of which I had already tried at that point.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">docker logs &lt;container_id_or_name&gt;

docker exec -it &lt;container_id_or_name&gt; sh
python /app/python-script.py
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob
service cron status
cat /var/log/syslog
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It is a gadget, nothing more.</p>

<p>I felt like I was asking questions to a junior developer who copy pasted code
from somewhere and handed it over without any testing. Everything it does
needs to be reviewed thoroughly. To me, it doesn’t seem like it can be used
for much more than generating some skeleton code, saving you a few keystrokes.</p>

<h3 id="the-horror">The Horror</h3>

<p>During technical interviews, I sometimes come across what I call a “Trial &amp; Error”-programmer:
They try something and then run the code, check if the result is correct and if it is not,
they try something different. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>I hope that ChatGPT and the like are not raising a generation of Trial &amp; Error programmers
because that is exactly how I am feeling after copy pasting code for a few hours and making
small adjustments here and there.</p>

<p>I quit this exercise the moment it spewed out the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-py">while True:
  schedule.run_pending()
  time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it a good idea to do that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>You raise a valid concern. Using an infinite loop with a sleep statement in the main script might not be the most efficient approach, as it can consume unnecessary resources.</em></p>

<p>After which it generated code without scheduling 😃</p>

<h4 id="reading-vs-writing">Reading vs Writing</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. …[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.”
― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or how about this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.” - Brian W</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ChatGPT is not helping you by generating code you do not understand, it is just making
debugging and future feature development that much harder, if it succeeded in
producing something that works.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<p>If you already know how to code and want to have 80% of your code generated for you,
you may want to have a look at using ChatGPT. Just remember that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It spits out random bugs, even in things that it got correct earlier (ex: “Image” -&gt; “Random Image” in the Slack webhook payload)</li>
  <li>It generates code and configuration that it does not actually use</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing that did impress me was that after I told it a few times “Nope, also doesn’t work”,
it gave some pretty good recommendations on how to debug and troubleshoot its (broken) solutions.</p>

<p>It seems to be quite good at solving really small very well known problems. I always forget the exact syntax for
<code>docker exec</code>. A simple prompt gave me a correct copy-pastable answer! That is to be expected considering how it
works beneath the hood I guess.</p>

<h3 id="introspection">Introspection</h3>

<p>From ChatGPT itself:</p>

<p><em>Programming requires creativity, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of various technologies. While I can offer guidance, suggestions, and code examples, it’s important to remember that human programmers bring their unique expertise, experience, and insights to the table. The human element is crucial in the programming process, and no AI can replicate the entirety of human skills and knowledge.</em></p>

<p><strong>Please consider me as a tool that can assist you in your programming journey, providing information, ideas, and helping with specific tasks.</strong> <em>However, the ingenuity and skill of human programmers remain essential for developing robust and innovative solutions.</em></p>

<p><em>If you have any further questions or need assistance with any programming topic, feel free to ask. I’m here to help in any way I can!</em></p>

<p>It was unable to tell me if that response was hardcoded or not.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I’m disappointed, for sure. It created a working Python script quite fast which got my hopes up,
but then it failed at what is typically the hardest part anyway: integration.</p>

<p>I will be using this to generate small things on the side. Like my Bash skills are below par,
I’m sure ChatGPT can give me something that already mostly works.</p>

<p>Oh man, I feel old, bitter and out of touch now.</p>]]></block2>

      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="docker-compose">docker-compose</h2>

<p>The <code>docker-compose</code> exists of two services</p>

<h3 id="file-server">File Server</h3>

<p><code>halverneus/static-file-server</code> makes the memes accessible from the internet.<br />
The Slack WebHook sends just the url of the meme, after which Slack attempts to
download the image before actually posting it.</p>

<p>If Slack cannot download the image, <strong>nothing</strong> will show up in your Slack channel.</p>

<p>You will probably need to configure the meme file accessibility.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">chmod -R 755 memes_dir
</code></pre>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="cron-job">Cron Job</h3>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> copies the <code>job</code> folder with the Node program to the docker container
and then runs <code>start.sh</code> which schedules running <code>meme-poster.js</code> and starts the Cron daemon.</p>

<h4 id="slack-meme-poster">Slack Meme Poster</h4>

<p>The <code>meme-poster.js</code> selects a random file from your <code>MEMES_DIR</code> and moves it to
a <code>already-sent</code> subfolder to make sure no meme is ever posted twice.</p>

<p>It then sends the meme url to Slack using the WebHook and 🎉, meme posted!</p>

      <title>Q&amp;A</title>
    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>As technology continues to advance at an exponential rate, the field of quality assurance (Q&amp;A) engineering is constantly evolving.
One of the current trends in Q&amp;A engineering is the <strong>increased use of automation</strong>. As the complexity of software applications continues to grow, so does the need for efficient and reliable testing methods. Automated testing can help speed up the testing process, improve accuracy, and reduce costs. With the use of advanced tools and techniques, automated testing can also be customized to fit the specific needs of each software project.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>Another trend in Q&amp;A engineering is the <strong>increased focus on security testing</strong>. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, it’s essential to ensure that software products are secure and protected from potential vulnerabilities. Security testing can identify any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in software systems, allowing developers to address them before they can be exploited.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>In addition to automation and security, another current trend in Q&amp;A engineering is <strong>the shift towards agile methodologies</strong>. Agile methodologies emphasize collaboration and flexibility, allowing for more efficient and effective software development. By using agile methodologies, Q&amp;A engineers can work closely with developers to ensure that software products are thoroughly tested throughout the development process, rather than waiting until the end.</p>

<p><br />
At itenium, we understand the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest trends in Q&amp;A engineering. That’s why we have a team of experienced testers available to help you keep your software up to par. <strong>Whether you need help with automation, security testing, or agile methodologies, we have the expertise to assist you</strong> in achieving your Q&amp;A goals. <a href="mailto:">Contact us today</a> to learn more about our services and how we can help you stay ahead of the curve.</p>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>A <strong>functional analyst</strong> is responsible for analyzing and understanding the functional requirements of a software system. They work closely with stakeholders, such as clients or end-users, to identify their needs and translate them into functional specifications that can be used by developers to build the software.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>The role of a functional analyst is critical to the success of a software development project. Without a functional analyst, there is a risk that the software will not meet the needs of the stakeholders, resulting in a product that is not useful or effective. The absence of a functional analyst can also lead to misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers, resulting in delays, rework, and increased costs.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>If a functional analyst is absent from a software development project, the project may experience a number of negative consequences. For example, there may be a lack of clarity around the project requirements, leading to misunderstandings and delays. The software may not be able to meet the needs of the stakeholders, resulting in dissatisfaction with the final product. There may also be a lack of coordination between the different teams involved in the project, leading to inefficiencies and errors.</p>

<p><br />
It is therefore important to have a talented functional analyst on a software development project. At itenium, <strong>our functional analysts have the expertise and experience needed to ensure that your project requirements are well understood</strong>, and that the software is built to meet those requirements. By <strong>working closely with stakeholders and developers</strong>, our functional analysts can help to ensure that your software development project is a success.</p>

    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>At a client where I worked on a Vaadin application that had to be upgraded from Vaadin version 8 to version 22, we encountered an interesting issue regarding the way translations were done in the application.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="how-the-translations-are-done">How the translations are done</h2>

<p>The application consisted of a bunch of views (parent components) which themselves had child components. The actual translation was done on the child component. A translation for a component is retrieved by forming a translation key for the component and using that key to check the translation table in the database for the translation value depending on the language set in the application.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p><strong>The translation key is formed as such</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/vaadin_translation_key_template.png" alt="Visual translation key formation" title="Pretty slick" /></p>

<p>The parent id is set on the parent component. The component type is defined by the component itself and we refer to its class name for that, for example for a checkbox component it would be checkbox. The component id is set on the component. The translation field depends on the component type. Some component types put the translation values in label fields and in that case the translation field would be “caption” (labels used to be captions in Vaadin version 8), some have the translations in div fields in which case the translation field is set as “div”.</p>

<p><strong>An example translation key would then look something like this</strong>:</p>

<p><code>productview.checkbox.isavailable.caption</code></p>

<p>The actual translation was then done by calling the static method translateLayout on the Translation utility class. This translateLayout method would take a parent component as an argument and would then loop through each child component within and for each child component it would proceed to form the translation key as defined above and do the translation by calling the static method translate which took the translation key as an argument and returned a translation.</p>

<p>This translateLayout method worked. Not great performance wise as a loop needed to occur before each parent component rendered with a bunch of translation calls to the database. But it didn’t have enough of an impact to warrant a refactor. Until the upgrade of course…</p>

<p><strong>translateLayout method</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void translateLayout(String mainComponentId, HasComponents layout) {
  for (Component component : layout) {
    translateComponent(mainComponentId, component);
  }
}

private static void translateComponent(String componentRoot, Component component) {
  String componentId = retrieveComponentId(component);
  if (Strings.isNotBlank(componentId)) {
    setComponent(componentRoot, component, componentId);
  }
}

private static void setComponent(String componentRoot, Component component, String componentId) {
  String componentClass = component.getClass().getSimpleName();

  String translation = translate(componentRoot, componentClass, componentId, ComponentType.CAPTION);
  if (translation != null) {
    component.setCaption(translation);
  }

  if (component instanceof AbstractComponent) {
    String desc = translate(componentRoot, componentClass, componentId, ComponentType.DESCRIPTION);
    if (desc != null) {
        ((AbstractComponent) component).setDescription(desc);
    }
  }

  if (component instanceof Label) {
    String value = translate(componentRoot, componentClass, componentId, ComponentType.VALUE);
    if (value != null) {
        ((Label) component).setValue(value);
    }
  }

  …etc
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-issue-in-the-upgrade">The issue in the upgrade</h2>

<p>So an interesting limitation was introduced somewhere in the versions between 8 and 22.</p>

<p><strong>Parent components defined as a TypeScript template file in Vaadin version 22</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">@customElement('cred-vouch-design')
export class CreditVouchDesign extends LitElement {
  static get styles() {
    return css`
      :host {
        display: block;
        height: 100%;
    
    `;
  }

  render() {
    return html`
      &lt;vaadin-vertical-layout style="width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: var(--lumo-space-m);"&gt;
        &lt;vaadin-text-field label="IB" id="ibTextField" type="text" tabindex=""
          style="width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;/vaadin-text-field&gt;
        &lt;vaadin-text-field label="Bz" id="bzTextField" type="text" tabindex=""
          style="width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;/vaadin-text-field&gt;
      &lt;/vaadin-vertical-layout&gt;
    `;
  }

  // Remove this method to render the contents of this view inside Shadow DOM
  createRenderRoot() {
    return this;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding java companion file that Vaadin creates for this template file on the server side would not allow you to access the child components within. I suppose this was done to further separate the client side from the server side of the application.</p>

<p>So we had 3 options to fix this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tinker with the framework so child components can be accessed. This was tried and failed and wouldn’t really be ideal as this functionality might change again in a future version and would need more tinkering. Our aim was for a more permanent solution</li>
  <li>Implement the translation logic fully on the client side in TypeScript as from the client side we do still have access to the child components from a parent component. This was a no go as well as we had the convention of having all the logic only on the server side.</li>
  <li>Find a different way of translating each component.</li>
</ul>

<p>Option 3 was the ideal way to fix this issue. The way we found to fix this issue was to do the translation from the other way around. No more using the translateLayout method. Each component would now call the existing translate method before it is rendered and do its translation. To call this translate method,  we had to create a custom component class for each Vaadin component. We then made this custom component class implement a TranslatableTitle interface that enforced the implementation of the translate method. This was a better futureproof way of handling translation as for each new component type introduced we would just need to create a new custom component class for that type and implement the TranslatableTitle interface. The old way would require us to add another if check inside the translateLayout method which wasn’t a very SOLID way of coding.</p>

<p><strong>Custom translatable component</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class CustomCheckbox extends Checkbox implements TranslatableTitle {
  private static final String TRANSLATION_TYPE = ".checkbox.";

  public CustomCheckbox() {
    getId().ifPresent(this::translateTitle);
  }

  @Override
  public void translateTitle(String id) {
    String translation = getTranslation(parentName + TRANSLATION_TYPE + id + CAPTION_TRANSLATION_KEY)
    CustomComponentUtil.getParentName(this).ifPresent(parentName -&gt; setLabel(translation));
  }
}

</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>A good way to summarize how we came to the solution for this translation issue is to say that we applied SOLID principles. More specifically the first two principles. Single responsibility principle was applied by moving the translating from the bloated translateLayout method to each component type. Open-Closed principle was applied by extending the existing Vaadin component types with our custom component type and adding our custom translation logic.</p>]]></block2>

<p>Some implementations use <code>\</code> instead of <code>$</code>.</p>

<p>Use non-capturing groups <code>(?:)</code> to keep your backreferences (<code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, …) in check.<br />
Or use named groups if supported in your regex implementation.</p>

<h2 id="looking-around">Looking around</h2>

<p>The last &amp; thoughest feature each developer should definitely know: lookahead &amp; lookbehind!</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/regex-lookaround.png" alt="Lookahead vs Lookbehind syntax" title="Lookahead vs Lookbehind syntax" /></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>A(?=B)   – Literal A followed by B
A(?!B)   – Literal A not followed by B
</code></pre>

<p>Lookarounds do not match anything in themselves which make them very handy
when you want to replace some text but only when it is (not) preceded/succeeded by something else.</p>]]></block2>

<p>How “easy” is to get a <strong>Line Chart</strong> working for each library?</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/React-Charting">Github source</a> for working examples of these!</p>

<h3 id="recharts">Recharts</h3>

<p>Time: 15 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>A smooth experience</strong>. Lots of stuff out-of-the-box with little or no configuration (ex: tooltip and legend).</p>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/react-charting-rechart.png" alt="Rechart line chart" title="Recharts: Line Chart" /></p>

<h5 id="code">Code</h5>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save recharts
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { CartesianGrid, Legend, Line, LineChart, Tooltip, XAxis, YAxis } from "recharts";

export function Recharts() {
  const persons = useSelector(state =&gt; state.persons);

  return (
    &lt;LineChart
      width={500}
      height={300}
      data={persons}
      margin={{ top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5 }}
    &gt;
      &lt;CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" /&gt;
      &lt;XAxis dataKey="name" /&gt;
      &lt;YAxis /&gt;
      &lt;Tooltip /&gt;
      &lt;Legend /&gt;
      &lt;Line type="monotone" dataKey="age" stroke="#8884d8" /&gt;
    &lt;/LineChart&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="visx">Visx</h3>

<p>Time: 29 minutes</p>

<p>The x and y axis configuration was done in a bit of a roundabout way, but the main problem and what took the longest time to set correctly was the tooltip. 
For some reason the library makes the tooltip data object use properties that have no relevance to the data being inserted in the chart.
It assumes all data inserted are datum objects whereas in this case they are person objects. The documentation also neglects to mention this in their example.</p>

<h5 id="example-1">Example</h5>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/react-charting-visx.png" alt="Visx line chart" title="Visx: Line Chart" /></p>

<h5 id="code-1">Code</h5>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save @visx/xychart
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { Axis, Grid, LineSeries, Tooltip, XYChart } from "@visx/xychart";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

export function Visx() {
  const persons = useSelector(state =&gt; state.persons);

  const accessors = {
    xAccessor: (d ?: IPerson) =&gt; d &amp;&amp; d.name,
    yAccessor: (d ?: IPerson) =&gt; d &amp;&amp; d.age,
  };

  return (
    &lt;XYChart
      width={500}
      height={300}
      xScale={{ type: "band" }}
      yScale={{ type: "linear" }}
    &gt;
      &lt;Axis orientation="bottom" /&gt;
      &lt;Axis orientation="left" /&gt;
      &lt;Grid columns={false} numTicks={4} /&gt;
      &lt;LineSeries dataKey="Line 1" data={persons} {...accessors} /&gt;
      &lt;Tooltip
        snapTooltipToDatumX
        snapTooltipToDatumY
        showVerticalCrosshair
        showSeriesGlyphs
        renderTooltip={({ tooltipData, colorScale }) =&gt; (
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;div style={{ color: colorScale?.(tooltipData?.nearestDatum?.key!) }}&gt;
              {tooltipData?.nearestDatum?.key}
            &lt;/div&gt;
            {accessors.xAccessor(tooltipData?.nearestDatum?.datum)}
            {", "}
            {accessors.yAccessor(tooltipData?.nearestDatum?.datum)}
          &lt;/div&gt;
        )}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/XYChart&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="nivo">Nivo</h3>

<p>Time: 29 minutes</p>

<p>My main gripe and time sink with this package was the issue that the data properties needed to be called x and y respectively,
so I needed to map my dataset to fit this mold. A simple setting for setting what properties you want to use on which axis would have been nice.
Big visual issue however as you can probably tell is that the values don’t exactly show correctly on the x axis.</p>

<h5 id="example-2">Example</h5>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/react-charting-nivo.png" alt="Nivo line chart" title="Nivo: Line Chart" /></p>

<h5 id="code-2">Code</h5>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save @nivo/core @nivo/line
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { Line } from "@nivo/line";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

export function Nivo() {
  const persons = useSelector(state =&gt; state.persons);
  const data = persons.map(p =&gt; ({ x: p.name, y: p.age }));

  return (
    &lt;Line
      width={500}
      height={300}
      curve="monotoneX"
      margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 60, left: 80 }}
      enableSlices="x"
      data={[{ id: "persons", data: data }]}
      xScale={{ type: "band" }}
      yScale={{ type: "linear" }}
      axisLeft={{ legend: "linear scale", legendOffset: 12 }}
      axisBottom={{ legend: "linear scale", legendOffset: -12 }}
    /&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="victory">Victory</h3>

<p>Time: 11 minutes</p>

<p>Usage was relatively easy, but it has the same limitation as the Nivo library because you also need to map your data properties to x and y. Also visually it doesn’t look as pleasing as some of the other charts in this list.</p>

<h5 id="example-3">Example</h5>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/react-charting-victory.png" alt="Victory line chart" title="Victory: Line Chart" /></p>

<h5 id="code-3">Code</h5>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save victory
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { VictoryChart, VictoryContainer, VictoryLine } from "victory";

export function Victory() {
  const persons = useSelector(state =&gt; state.persons);
  const data = persons.map(p =&gt; ({ x: p.name, y: p.age }));

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;VictoryChart
        height={300}
        width={500}
        containerComponent={&lt;VictoryContainer responsive={false} /&gt;}
      &gt;
        &lt;VictoryLine data={data} /&gt;
      &lt;/VictoryChart&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="react-vis">React-vis</h3>

<p>Time: 35 minutes</p>

<p>I could not get this chart to render remotely well.
The documentation did not really help either in this case.
Also I needed to map the data properties to x and y as well again.</p>

<h5 id="example-4">Example</h5>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/react-charting-react-vis.png" alt="React-vis line chart" title="React-vis: Line Chart" /></p>

<h5 id="code-4">Code</h5>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save react-vis
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { XYPlot, XAxis, YAxis, HorizontalGridLines, LineSeries } from "react-vis";

export function ReactVis() {
  const persons = useSelector(state =&gt; state.persons);
  const data = persons.map(p =&gt; ({ x: p.name, y: p.age }));

  return (
    &lt;XYPlot width={500} height={300} xType="ordinal"&gt;
      &lt;HorizontalGridLines /&gt;
      &lt;XAxis /&gt;
      &lt;YAxis /&gt;
      &lt;LineSeries color='red' data={data} /&gt;
    &lt;/XYPlot&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="react-chartjs-2">React-chartjs-2</h3>

<p>Time: 35 minutes</p>

<p>Documentation for this library was kind of limited, especially when it came to creating a line chart.
An annoying trait is that you have to split your dataset up in into a labels array for the x axis and data array for the y axis.
The end result does look nice however.</p>

<h5 id="example-5">Example</h5>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/react-charting-react-chartjs-2.png" alt="React-chartjs-2 line chart" title="React-chartjs-2: Line Chart" /></p>

<h5 id="code-5">Code</h5>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save react-chartjs-2 chart.js
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { Chart as ChartJS, CategoryScale, LinearScale, PointElement, LineElement, Title, Tooltip, Legend } from "chart.js";
import { Line } from "react-chartjs-2";

ChartJS.register(CategoryScale, LinearScale, PointElement, LineElement, Title, Tooltip, Legend);

const options = {
  responsive: false,
  plugins: {
    legend: {
      position: "top" as const,
    },
    title: {
      display: true,
      text: "Chart.js Line Chart",
    },
  },
};

export function ReactChartJS2() {
  const persons = useSelector(state =&gt; state.persons);
  const labels: string[] = persons.map(person =&gt; person.name);
  const ages: number[] = persons.map(person =&gt; person.age);
  const data = {
    labels,
    datasets: [{
      label: "Dataset 1",
      data: ages,
      borderColor: "rgb(255, 99, 132)",
      backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.5)",
    }],
  };

  return (
    &lt;Line width={500} height={300} options={options} data={data} /&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<h3 id="onur-recharts">Onur: Recharts</h3>

<p>First time was a charm, the first library <strong>Recharts</strong> did everything I wanted it to in a clear and convenient manner. 
It’s the only library where I didn’t really have a complaint. It’s easy to use and has very good documentation.</p>

<h3 id="wouter-nivo">Wouter: Nivo</h3>

<p>Disclaimer: I didn’t actually implement the Line Charts.</p>

<p>The out of the box experience of the Line Chart was, for me, really nice for Recharts, <strong>Nivo</strong> and React-ChartJS-2.</p>

<p>I was really impressed with the documentation of <strong>Nivo</strong>: a <strong>very</strong> interactive gallery plus a storybook implementation, just wow.
The dev team also seems to be on top of things with 81 open issues and a whopping 1393 closed ones. It’s the only library
with a below v1 version though and has not yet gained as much traction (300k weekly downloads) compared to current leaders
Recharts (1.5M) and React-chartjs-2 (950k), the latter which coasts of the popularity of <code>Chart.js</code> itself.</p>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>In the world of software development, Java has long been one of the most widely used programming languages. Its versatility and reliability make it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to enterprise software systems. However, staying up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in Java can be a challenge, especially for busy development teams with tight project deadlines.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>So what are some of the latest trends in Java that you need to be aware of? One of the most significant is <strong>the rise of microservices architecture</strong>. This approach to software development involves breaking applications down into smaller, independent components that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately. This can help to streamline development and deployment processes, improve scalability and resilience, and reduce the risk of downtime and other issues.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>Another important trend is <strong>the growing popularity of cloud-based development and deployment</strong>. Cloud platforms like <strong>AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud</strong> offer a range of tools and services that can help to simplify and accelerate the development and deployment of Java applications. They also provide robust infrastructure and security features that can help to ensure the reliability and availability of your applications.</p>

      <title>XAMARIN vs MAUI</title>
    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>On the 8th of November 2022 .NET 7 was released, including .NET MAUI (.NET Multi-platform App UI). In this blogpost we will investigate the differences between Xamarin.Forms and its successor.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>What is its purpose and how it evolved in the framework and platform it is now? What will the future bring for these two environments? We will end this blog post with the advantages of .Net Maui over Xamarin.Forms and the evolution of Xamarin.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="xamarin">Xamarin</h3>

<p>Xamarin was introduced in May 2011 with the foundation of the Xamarin Company. It was created with a commercial purpose, until it was acquired by Microsoft in 2016. It was based on the mono project introduced in 2001.</p>

<p>The platform is used for cross-platform mobile applications where 90% of the code is shared over multiple platforms like ios, android and windows. It is a single-language platform, C#, which opened the path for cross platform development in the .Net ecosystem and all his advantages. The purpose of Microsoft was to migrate Xamarin in the .NET Base Class Library.</p>

<h3 id="xamarinforms">Xamarin.Forms</h3>

<p>This is an open source UI framework that allows developers to create user interfaces as an abstraction layer over native controls on each platform (Android, IOS or windows). The framework uses one shared project, where 90% of the code resides, and platform specific projects for native development. With the release of the new framework(.NET MAUI) support will end on the 1st of may 2024, with Android 13 and XCode 14 as the latest supported native SDK’s.</p>

<h3 id="net-maui">.NET MAUI</h3>

<p>With the introduction of Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms out of the way, we can now look at .Net Maui itself. This open source UI framework is developed by the same team. With .NET 7, this rewrite of Xamarin.Forms had its first official release on the 8th of november. With its release Xamarin is completely pulled into the .NET base class library as part of the journey to one .NET. This new UI framework of .NET contains several changes, but still has some basic features that already existed in Xamarin Forms like controls, Shell, Templates, … .</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-differences-with-xamarinforms">What are the differences with Xamarin.Forms</h3>

<h4 id="project-structure">Project structure</h4>

<p>The biggest difference is the project structure, as Xamarin.Forms has multiple projects .NET MAUI has only one project. As you can see in the underlying example.</p>

<figure class="imagewrapper" style="max-width: 360px">
    <img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/xamarin-vs-maui-project-tree.png" alt="Project tree" title="" class="img-responsive" />

    
    <figcaption>.Net Maui and Xamarin project tree</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<h4 id="more-target-platforms-are-supported">More target platforms are supported</h4>

<p>As you can see in the project structure above, .NET MAUI supports more targets than its predecessor.</p>

<h4 id="net-cli-support">.NET CLI support</h4>

<p>You can create, build and emulate you Maui application from within .NET CLI. Therefore you need to install the .Net SDK. <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download"><code>download here</code></a></p>

<p>With the SDK installed you can run the next command for creating a new maui project in the current folder.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">dotnet new maui
</code></pre>

<h4 id="net-7">.NET 7</h4>

<p>As Maui is build in inside .Net 7, it takes advantage of it. It does not only support xaml hot reload, but also .Net hot reload. It enables faster app startup through improved memory usage.</p>

<h4 id="controls-with-handlers">Controls with handlers</h4>

<p>Controls are managed through a handler architecture which makes it loosely coupled from the native controls, as Xamarin.Forms makes use of renderers which are tightly coupled.</p>

<h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>

<p>Because .NET MAUI only has one project, resource management is simplified in that one location. Images do not need to be maintained in each platform specific project but are also manageable from within that single project. Adding an svg file is sufficient to add new resources.</p>

<h4 id="blazor">Blazor</h4>

<p>With .NET MAUI you can build Blazor applications with C# instead of javascript.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>.NET MAUI is the result of pulling Xamarin into the .NET BCL. It contains many features from Xamarin Forms and has many improvements to show the potential of this new UI framework.</p>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>You already know regex is a (very) useful skill? Skip to the <a href="https://itenium.be/blog/productivity/regex-tutorial">Tutorial</a>.
If not, allow me to convince you…</p>

<p class="notice">Some people, when confronted with a problem, think ‘I know, I’ll use regular expressions.’ Now they have two problems.
<strong>- <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">Jeffrey Friedl’s Blog</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Or the XKCD version</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/regex-xkcd-problems.png" alt="Perl Problems" title="Perl Problems (https://xkcd.com/1171)" /></p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p><br />
<br />
Okay maybe that was not a good start trying to convince you to learn regex.</p>

<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>

<p class="notice"><strong>You don’t know you need to know regex until you know regex.</strong></p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h3 id="applicability">Applicability</h3>

<p>Regular Expressions are typically used for user <strong>input validation</strong>.
Another good fit is <strong>extracting, deleting and/or reorganising text</strong>.
Replace a dozen lines of <code>Substring</code> and <code>IndexOf</code> with one ‘pretty’ regex!</p>

<p>Other usage in code might be suspect: does the readability really benefit from the regex
or does it just make things more complex.</p>

<p class="notice--info">Be sure to have Unit Tests for all input you’d like to support.<br />
You’ll need them whenever requirements change or bugs need to be fixed.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><br />
Even with this seemingly limited applicability - if you don’t want to shoot yourself in the foot that is -
regexes are still a very useful tool as they can be used in many one time actions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find in (all project) files in your IDE or in a SQL DB</li>
  <li>Quickly find interesting stuff in big files (think logs, data dumps, csvs, etc)</li>
  <li>Convert data that came from A to what B likes</li>
  <li>Many a CLI tool or its parameters understands regex
    <ul>
      <li>You can even use ‘regex’ in Excel and Word…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are the reason this series is posted under the productivity category.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Whenever I fix a bug that was the result of an error that might have happened in other places as well,
I might use a regex to find those, even if the other code contains different variable names,
code style etc it would still find them - at least if the regex was written in a way that takes
the context into account.</p>

<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>

<p>Don’t forget about tooling.
Having <strong>direct feedback on what your regex is matching on your dataset as you type it</strong>.. It’s the best 😃<br />
Any IDE worth its salt has this capability.</p>

<p>Learn to work with <strong>multiple cursors</strong> in your IDE. It is a strong and capable companion to regex:<br />
Why write the perfect find &amp; replace regex when you can write a simplistic regex on the top of your
head and handle the replacement details with multiple cursor trickery?</p>

<p>You want to avoid falling into the trap of spending more time on your regex than you would spend doing it manually.</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/regex-time-trade-off.png" alt="Manual vs Regex Time Trade-Off" title="Manual vs Regex Time Trade-Off" /></p>

<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>

<p><a href="https://regexone.com">RegExOne</a>: An interactive tutorial!</p>

<p>Not necessarily learning resources, but still pretty handy:
interactive RegEx testers. Paste a RegEx you found and
match it against your input. Plus they explain the regex visually.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://regexr.com/">RegExr</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://regex101.com/">RegEx101</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.debuggex.com/?flavor=javascript">debuggex</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://extendsclass.com/regex-tester.html">cyrilex</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mastering Regular Expressions</strong></p>

<p>Even though the name of the book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/0596528124">Mastering Regular Expressions</a>
it still starts really slow and is perfectly readable by someone with no (or very little) regex experience.</p>

<h2 id="the-why-not">The Why Not</h2>

<p>Always be wary before resorting to regex 😉</p>

<h3 id="implementations">Implementations</h3>

<p>As if RegExes are not confusing enough in and by themselves, there are different implementations of regex.
While all implementations are largely the same, you may still find yourself in a situation where the regex
works perfectly in your IDE but not from your application.</p>

<p>Some examples (or <a href="https://gist.github.com/CMCDragonkai/6c933f4a7d713ef712145c5eb94a1816">a full list</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Features not implemented. ex: named capture groups in JS (since added in <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-named-groups">ECMAScript 2018</a>)</li>
  <li><code>\b</code> vs <code>&lt;|&gt;</code> for example in Visual Studio</li>
  <li>Different behavior of ‘small’ syntax errors. ex: throwing vs silently continuing</li>
  <li>.NET has <code>(?#comment)</code>, Java has not. Java has <code>\Q...\E</code>, .NET has not</li>
</ul>

<!--
Naah, not funny enough
![Basically too many differences](/blog/assets/blog-images/regex-hate.jpg "Basically too many differences")
-->

<h3 id="inapplicability">Inapplicability</h3>

<h4 id="html">Html</h4>

<p>There are the obvious ones: throwing <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454">regex against HTML</a> or XML.</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/regex-html.png" alt="HTML Parsing" title="HTML Parsing" /></p>

<p><strong>Use a parser instead</strong>. And then you can throw some jquery against it or whatever API your language exposes.
It’s going to be a lot more readable, maintainable and more robust to changes in the HTML.</p>

<p>I might get hate mail for posting this on the interwebs (or worse) but really: if you have
<strong>some HTML or XML</strong> which you know always has <strong>the exact same structure</strong> and you need
to <strong>do something simple</strong>, well… Why not? What’s the worst that can happen by using a regex to extract
<code>&lt;SomeUniqueNode&gt;SOME ID WITH KNOWN STRUCTURE&lt;/SomeUniqueNode&gt;</code> and save you importing a third
party library which is probably bloated and inefficiently written?</p>

<h4 id="everywhere">Everywhere</h4>

<p>I once worked with a senior developer who, I think, had just discovered regex.
And, he had become so fond of them (or something?) that all code he touched was littered with little regexes after.
I mean, why keep <code>str.split('|')[0]</code> around when you can replace it with a regex, right.</p>

<p>To top it off, all his regexes were needlessly long, most of them could be written in
1/3 or even in 1/2 of his “style”.</p>

<p>Which is how we fluently arrive at…</p>

<h3 id="writing-vs-reading">Writing vs Reading</h3>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/regex-writing-vs-reading.png" alt="Writing vs Reading RegEx" title="Writing vs Reading RegEx" /></p>

<p>It’s funny because it’s true. Requirements change and well, good luck deciphering your own regex.<br />
Or heaven forbids, one someone else wrote! 😱</p>

<h2 id="the-real-why">The <strong>REAL</strong> Why</h2>

<p>Let’s be honest here…</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/regex-xkcd-fantasy.png" alt="Perl Problems" title="Perl Problems (https://xkcd.com/208/)" /></p>

<p><strong>Moving on</strong></p>

<p>Did I already mention that you’ll want to have tests of the code using regexes, especially if they tend
to change often? Don’t be shy to write them, even if they are the only ones in your repository.</p>]]></block2>

    <a href="https://github.com/skovhus/jest-codemods">skovhus/jest-codemods</a>:
        Codemods for migrating to Jest</p>

<p>Instead of going through the entire Jest documentation to find out
what the differences are between Jasmine and Jest, I just used
<code>jest-codemods</code> followed by a <code>git diff</code>.</p>

<!--
I had some trouble getting `jest-codemods` to actually do something, so in the end
I just selected "_All of the above (use with care)!_" in its interactive CLI and that worked
just great 😃
-->

<p>I can be so efficient sometimes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npx jest-codemods --help
npx jest-codemods .
</code></pre>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Create a <code>jest.config.ts</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npx jest --init
</code></pre>

<p>In Jasmine there was <code>spec/helpers</code>, now the entry point for global configuration is in
<code>jest.config.ts</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">// A list of paths to modules that run some code to configure
// or set up the testing framework before each test
setupFilesAfterEnv: ["./setupJest.js"],
</code></pre>

<p>Example <code>setupJest.js</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">// Set a global variable
global.__DEV__ = true;

// Or a global function
global.t = t =&gt; t;

// Custom equality tester
// Return undefined if you want to give other testers a chance
const reInventToBe = (a, b) =&gt; a === b;
expect.addEqualityTesters([reInventToBe]);

// Custom matchers
expect.extend({ yourMatcher });
</code></pre>

<h3 id="custom-matchers">Custom Matchers</h3>

<p>Use <code>expect.extend</code> instead of <code>jasmine.addMatchers</code>.</p>

<p>The return type of a custom matcher is slightly different in Jest:
The <code>message</code> type changes from <code>string</code> to <code>() =&gt; string</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">expect.extend({
  yourMatcher(actual, expected, y, z) {
    return {
      pass: true,
      message: () =&gt; {
        const prettyActual = this.utils.printReceived(actual);
        const prettyExpected = this.utils.printExpected(expected);
        return `${prettyActual} is not something by ${prettyExpected}`;
      },
    };
  },
});

// Usage
expect(100).yourMatcher(99, 'param-y', 'param-z');
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-differences">The Differences</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In Jest <code>test</code> is an alias for <code>it</code>.</li>
  <li><code>jasmine.xxx</code> matchers typically translate directly to <code>expect.xxx</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>Ex: <code>jasmine.arrayContaining</code> –&gt; <code>expect.arrayContaining</code>.</li>
      <li>Jasmine has some (pretty useless) without equivalent in Jest.</li>
      <li>But Jest has bunches more than Jasmine…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Jest has <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/api#each">test.each</a> to run an array of inputs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="spies">Spies</h3>

<p>There are some differences in syntax when using spies, most is solved automatically by the code-mod.
Jest offers a cleaner API with additional functionality.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">But a <strong>big</strong> difference here is that while Jasmine does not execute the original implementation,
Jest <strong>DOES</strong>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">// Setting up the Spy
const mataHari = {
  setBar(value, times) {return value * times;}
};

// The same behavior in Jasmine: spyOn(x, y).and.callThrough()
const spie = jest.spyOn(mataHari, 'setBar');


// If you want to mimick Jasmine behavior of NOT calling the original impl:
// In this case it doesn't matter much because there are no side effects
// If you are mocking an API call, you may want the Jasmine behavior instead!
// jest.spyOn(mataHari, 'setBar').mockImplementation(() =&gt; 0);


// Making calls
mataHari.setBar(1);
mataHari.setBar(2, 10);

// Inspecting calls
expect(mataHari.setBar.mock.calls[0][0]).toBe(1);
expect(mataHari.setBar.mock.calls[1][0]).toBe(2);
expect(mataHari.setBar.mock.calls[1][1]).toBe(10);
expect(mataHari.setBar.mock.lastCall[1]).toBe(10);

// Inspecting call returns
expect(mataHari.setBar.mock.results).toHaveLength(2);
expect(mataHari.setBar.mock.results[1].type).toBe('return'); // or 'throw'
expect(mataHari.setBar.mock.results[1].value).toBe(20); // == 2 * 10

// Clearing calls, results, ...
expect(mataHari.setBar.mock.calls).toHaveLength(2);
spie.mockClear();
expect(mataHari.setBar.mock.calls).toHaveLength(0);

// Also remove any mockReturnValue etc
spie.mockReset();

// In an afterEach or something
jest.restoreAllMocks();
</code></pre>

<h3 id="proxyquire--mocks">proxyquire –&gt; Mocks</h3>

<p>Replace the <code>api.js</code> dependency in <code>cut.js</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const apiStub = {};

// proxyquire
const proxyquire = require('proxyquire');
const cut = proxyquire('./cut.js', {'./api.js': apiStub});

// Jest
jest.mock('./api.js', () =&gt; apiStub);
const cut = require('./cut.js');
</code></pre>

<p>So the <code>proxyquire</code> package is not needed in Jest.
Jest mocks are also much more versatile…</p>

<h3 id="async">Async</h3>

<p>Jasmine has <code>done.fail(err)</code>. This has been simplified to just <code>done(err)</code> in Jest.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const pie = Promise.resolve(3.14);

// Jasmine
await expectAsync(pie).toBeResolvedTo(3.14);

// Jest
return expect(pie).resolves.toBe(3.14);

// Jest: Setting up mock Promises
const p1 = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(1);
const p2 = jest.fn().mockRejectedValue(err);
// is shorthand for
const p1 = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() =&gt; Promise.resolve(1));
</code></pre>

<h2 id="vscode-integration">VSCode Integration</h2>

<p>Jest works out of the box when using <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/debugging-tests"><code>create-react-app</code></a>!
(link contains the VSCode <code>launch.json</code>) after installing the Jest VSCode Extension:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">

    </a>
    <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest">jest-community/vscode-jest</a>:
        The optimal flow for Jest based testing in VS Code</p>

<p><strong>How it looks</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/vscode-jest-test-runner.png" alt="Visual UnitTest result cues in Visual Studio Code" title="Pretty slick" /></p>

<h3 id="notifications">Notifications?</h3>

<p>Set <code>notify: true</code> in <code>jest.config.ts</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install -S node-notifier
</code></pre>

<p>And get that dopamine shot every time it says 0 tests failed 😃</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Key points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have an existing code base, use <code>jest-codemods</code>.</li>
  <li>The matcher syntax is almost 100% identical.</li>
  <li>Timers syntax <code>jasmine.clock</code> vs <code>jest.useFakeTimers</code>
    <ul>
      <li>It’s a completely different API</li>
      <li>But it’s converted 100% by the code-mod</li>
      <li>Jest offers more control over timers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Spies: A slightly different API, also code-modded for you!</li>
  <li>proxyquire is built in with <code>jest.mock</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Next up, the real reason to switch to Jest: React Component testing.</p>

<p>Well aside of, you know, the very nice VSCode integration which works
out of the box with <code>create-react-app</code>.</p>

<p>Also note that today is truly the perfect day to publish a “Jest” article!</p>]]></block2>

<p>Within the 20 years of working as a woman in IT, I am used to being part of the minority, female professionals. I graduated as the only female in the class of “Analyst programmer” and never had more than a handful of colleagues with the same gender.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>Did this trigger the urge of visiting the European women in Technology event in Amsterdam? Yeah… slightly afraid of being the only one in the conference…</p>

    <figcaption>The conference building</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>After some issues finding the correct building in the Amsterdam RAI (Don’t start with the typical: “Yeah, woman and orientation…” Because I worked so closely with men for over more than 2 decades, I know this is not gender related ;-) ) I was amazed by the quantity of female attendees.</p>

<p>The second thing I was amazed of was the number of keynote, deep dives and workshops that were given by, yes: Only female leaders.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion-di-should-be-embedded-in-the-whole-company-not-only-hr">“Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) should be embedded in the WHOLE company, not only HR”</h2>

<p>The biggest topic of the conference was Diversity and Inclusion. This is all about the value of having gender, race and age diversity within your company.  Gillian Tans, former Ceo of booking.com phrased this very well by stating “Diversity drives more innovation and more creativity in your company. It should be embedded in the whole company, not only in recruiting new employees.“</p>

<p>Why do we need this focus? To be able to represent a more realistic diversity, a diversity more in balance with the real world’s population.</p>

<p>The question is: How? Tine Slabbinck, Manager of Toyota Belgium, explained how Toyota managed to double their female managers within 3 year by endorsing and guiding all female IT employees with mentors and starting a female community.</p>

<h2 id="quotas-are-good-because-they-give-attention-to-the-issue-but-can-also-scare-potential-female-candidates-away-from-applying">“Quotas are good because they give attention to the issue, but can also scare potential female candidates away from applying”</h2>

<p>A lot of companies focus on raising the diversity with quotas and mentorship. Gillian Tans commented: The Quotas are good to give attention to the issue, but with the risk women might fail because they are only hired because of the quotas. Watching these women fail can scare potential female candidates away from applying.
Quotas are also most of the time a “top down” strategy, the advice of Gillian Tans is to try “bottom up”, as this is the only way it can be owned by the whole company.</p>

<p>Taking more time in the hiring process, at Vinted this takes up to 2 to 3 months, also increases the chance of hiring a great female employee. Taking time in the hiring process prevents you from having a lot of headaches in trying to move an underperforming employee towards another team so it’s not your issue anymore, or efforts in saying goodbye after a hobbling journey.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-dont-receive-a-diverse-selection-of-potential-candidates-send-your-recruiters-back-to-work">“If you don’t receive a diverse selection of potential candidates, send your recruiters back to work”</h2>

<p>Carol Parillon, chief data architect at Shell, stated in her topic “Data driven architecture: The rise of the data product” that a strong data culture puts employees in the center.</p>

<p>Shell worked for over 10 years on the data foundations and are now in the stage of a data driven governance: This is when the business owns the data, not the ‘data department’ somewhere hiding in a dark corner of the company’s building. Some numbers to really get blown away: Shell owns 2.7 trillion rows of data, 100 million customers and has +150 data architects. The next shift they are facing now is the move from centralized to decentralized data and bringing Data as a Product towards the customers.</p>

<p>Because of this data driven governance, employees will make data driven decisions and endorse the company’s growth. By having diverse employees you can accelerate your business even more as they will represent, again, the global humanity. “Send your recruiters back to work if they only come up with male candidates, they don’t represent the real world”</p>

<p>Another topic that really got my attention was from Aurelija Pletiene, Director of engineering at Vinted: Drama free collaboration between Business &amp; IT. Drama queens and kings can block your business development and decision making process for ages.</p>

<h2 id="eliminate-the-drama-between-business-and-it-put-them-both-in-one-team">“Eliminate the drama between business and IT: put them both in one team”</h2>

<p>If you ever worked in, or with, an IT team you will for sure relate to the drama that can be created by communication issues: The IT team thinks they work so hard to develop and support a service and business doesn’t understand a word of what they are exactly doing.</p>

<p>When including business in the team, Vinted learned that the issues in communication decreased severely. Even in the Infrastructure team they added a business representative and ended up with: Work hard, Have fun, No drama.</p>

<p>This approach fully supports my idea of what a best performing agile product team should look like: able to design and develop a product without the need of a crowd of ‘business stakeholders’. Business should be included in the team. Stakeholders are the customers / end users.</p>

<p>“Get into the heart of the onion to understand the value of your project”
Rita Kaur, EMAE sales leader of Tiktok, enriched us all in her topic “What Could I Possibly Learn From Salespeople” with 3 great tips to enhance your career as a woman in Tech.</p>

<h3 id="1-ask-better-questions">1 Ask better questions</h3>

<p>To be able to communicate better to business it’s important to understand the real value you are bringing, not just the task you need to execute. Peel the onion until you get into the heart of it, what are we really trying to accomplish? If you understand the real Why, the best solutions will come up.</p>

<h3 id="2-listen-to-the-unspoken">2 Listen, to the unspoken</h3>

<p>The majority of communication is non verbal: It’s not WHAT we say that matters the most, it’s HOW we say it. We are all emotional human beings, also the ones at c-level ;-) If you listen more actively, slow down the communication and really listen, you can build trust towards each other. If you ever read Patrick Lencioni - The FIVE Dysfunctions of a Team - you will know trust is the base of good collaboration.</p>

<h3 id="3-communicate-the-value-not-the-task">3 Communicate the value, not the task</h3>

<p>If you can communicate on the value, business will understand at last what you are doing behind those big screens the whole day. Communicating the added value to the business will endorse the value you and your team are bringing to the company.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-kill-your-darling-but-dont-lose-the-team">“If you kill your darling but don’t lose the team”</h2>

<p>The third main focus was Empathy: One of the major values you bring in the company when hiring more women than a handful of outliers. (A side note to this was stated: also don’t switch the balance: You really don’t want to have 90% of women in the company.)</p>

<p>Some great deepdive was given by Claudia Vicol - director Of Engineering at A.P Moller - Maersk - “How to kill your darlings”</p>

<p>We all know someone that created this great tool, a long time ago, that became the backbone of the company, and that single person is keeping the tool alive. If you are lucky enough, the tool is kept alive by a team, not a single person. A good leader should, if it’s only one person keeping the tool alive, have big red alerts all over the place and create a way this support would be taken over by a support team. Reducing risks has a high value towards the business.</p>

<p>‘Keeping the tool alive’ is not always the best solution: If the tool doesn’t have any reason or value to stay alive: Kill it with fire!</p>

<p>But be aware and conscious about the risk it’s someone else’s baby: For this person/team this is personal. Don’t make the mistake of assessing the value by yourself: Involve the team/person, so they understand they matter, also without the tool they supported for a long time quantified with the number of empty pizza boxes and hours late at night. They will feel appreciated and have energy to move forward to the next great product with more value for the company.</p>

<h2 id="yes-i-will">“Yes, I will”</h2>

<p>I didn’t manage to follow all the sessions and for sure I forgot to mention half of the great inspiring talks, as they were with so many in a very short timeframe. Also very interesting topics about the value of the new web 3.0: the Metaverse and all topics related to products, gaming and observability instead of monitoring reached my brains in 30min/topic. Time to process these wonderful new insights for some days.</p>

<p>Am I willing to dive again into the European Women in Technology summit next year? Hell yeah, Girl power in tech rules!</p>

      <title>〠 First Hack</title>
    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>A long, long time ago, when games like <a href="https://utopia-game.com">Utopia</a> and <a href="http://www.planetarion.com/">Planetarion</a> were all the rage,
I started playing Ambar (since down) with a few friends. This could be the story of why one should have an IT-guy in the team.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h2>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/first-hack-ambar-logo.jpg" alt="Ambar logo" title="Ambar logo" /></p>

<p>During one age of the browser game Ambar, we were playing an empire in which our strategy was to grow like mad but without training any troops.
If we could outgrow everyone fast enough, no one would be able to open a magical portal to our empire to attack us, since portal-opening was based on empire size.
This was kind of the idea because as you can guess, having no troops in a war game usually is.. problematic.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-portal">The Portal</h2>

<p>And… Turns out we hadn’t grown enough, fast enough because right after the initial no-attack period an enemy empire did succeed in opening a portal to us 😲.<br />
Usually this is not really a problem, as there is a spell to close a portal should someone open one to an “undesirable” target - in our case <strong>any</strong> other empire.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for our “strategy” to work, we all needed to pick a certain race providing us with the correct perks and bonuses during registration.
And of course this race did not posses the capability to cast the “Close Portal” spell. At this point, we were ready for the slaughterhouse.</p>

<h2 id="the-hack">The Hack</h2>

<p>Casting a spell in Ambar was as simple as selecting it from a dropdown menu:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;select&gt;
    &lt;option value="0"&gt;No Spell Selected&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="1"&gt;Divine Sight&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="4"&gt;Echos of the Past&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="6"&gt;Open Portal&lt;/option&gt;
    ... and more spells ...
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And all I did was save the Html locally, add the spells not available to my race to the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>
and add a little <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base"><code>&lt;base /&gt;</code></a> tag.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;base href="http://www.darklights.com/cgi-bin/game/login"&gt;
&lt;select&gt;
    &lt;option value="7"&gt;Close Portal&lt;/option&gt;
    ... and all other spells in game ...
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And 💥, the portal closed, our empire saved from those heinous invaders and me wondering why they didn’t do this little check on the backend.</p>

<p>I did get an IM from someone of the attacking empire asking how exactly we managed to magically close the portal since no one in our empire had the required race to do so ;)</p>

<h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>

<p>All user input is evil.</p>

<p>Have a backup plan in case risky plan A goes awry.</p>

<p>I’m a cheat and should’ve been banned.</p>]]></block2>

      <title>CQRS + CRUD</title>
    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="a-ramble-against-cqrs">A ramble against CQRS</h2>

<p>A lot of interesting articles have been published about <strong>Command Query Responsibility Segregation</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a mere rant. Not necessarily against CQRS per se, but against <strong>when</strong>
it is being applied in spite of Martin Fowlers cautionary words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some situations, this separation can be valuable, but beware
that <strong>for most systems CQRS adds risky complexity</strong>.<br />
— <em>Martin Fowler (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS Article</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always loved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">CQS</a>.
How could one not, it makes perfect sense that <code>getUser(5)</code>
would return user “5” and not do much else, perhaps there is some caching in place
but one would hope it doesn’t actually create a User record or something.</p>

<p>Then Greg Young introduced CQRS: An architectural pattern that allows us
to add nice things, like Event Sourcing or a reporting database pretty easily.
Adding such significant changes might be much easier compared to the impact on a more classical
architecture, even when doing so late in the development life cycle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite these benefits, <strong>you should be very cautious about using CQRS</strong><br />
— <em>Martin Fowler</em></p>
</blockquote>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>In his entire article on CQRS, this is the only sentence that Martin has put in bold.</p>

<p>Unfortunately developers like the latest and greatest very much and CQRS has, for many organizations
and teams been put forward as the de facto standard architecture.</p>

<p>There is of course that one project where it makes a lot of sense but let’s be realistic,
most of us are working on enterprise applications which are all pretty much CRUD.</p>

<p>So let’s explore what usually happens when you use CQRS for a CRUD application…</p>

<h2 id="the-cqrs-mayhem">The CQRS Mayhem</h2>

<p>An often overlooked aspect of design patterns are the <code>Consequences</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does the pattern support its objectives? What are the trade-offs
and results of using the pattern? What aspect of the system structure does it
let you vary independently?<br />
— <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is a whole point to this blog post it’s probably:</p>

<p class="notice">The aspect of a CQRS system that benefits most from using the pattern
is adding new ways to display, update and create existing entities.
<strong>This is the one thing that typically doesn’t happen in a CRUD system.</strong></p>

<p>When applying CQRS to something that is 80% CRUD to all 100% of the application,
you have not properly assessed the patterns’ <code>Applicability</code> nor its <code>Intent</code>
and are left only with its <code>Consequences</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/CQRS-Ramble-Consequences.jpg" alt="There will be consequences meme" title="There will be consequences" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h3 id="an-explosion-of-classes">An Explosion of Classes</h3>

<p>A create and an update probably save to the same place in the same structure.</p>

<p>So you need to do a mapping from 2 models to the “database” structure. I’m sure you have a mapper
for that, so you now have 2 mappers. Oh and of course also 2 controllers, perhaps 2 services
and also 2 validators. And 2 repositories and 2 dtos and 2 handlers and uhm do you not need
a separate interface type for all these? We want to talk to an interface, not an implementation
after all!</p>

<p>Instead of a delete/getOne just passing along an <code>int id</code> we will now also introduce
good old <code>DeleteModelRequest</code> and <code>GetModelByIdRequest</code>: Because who doesn’t like a hundred classes with one <code>int Id</code> field in them.
Even if you don’t want them, you’ll probably end up with a package that requires a specific type per command for its wiring.</p>

<p>So yeah, the amount of types in your application will grow. Dramatically.</p>

<h3 id="an-explosion-of-duplication">An Explosion of Duplication</h3>

<p>Well since it’s CRUD you are bound to be doing the exact same thing multiple times. Right.. not exactly the same thing of course,
there is that one field… in which entity was it again?</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/CQRS-Ramble-Duplication-Everywhere.jpg" alt="Duplication!? Duplication everywhere!" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The CreateHandler for entity 1 will look very much like the one for entity 2.</li>
  <li>The CreateRequest and UpdateRequest for an entity will also very much look alike.</li>
  <li>All DeleteRequests and GetByIdRequests will look exactly the same.</li>
  <li>The mapping from the CreateModel and the UpdateModel to the persistence model…</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="confusion-on-the-frontend">Confusion on the frontend</h3>

<p>An update screen is usually populated with existing values. You have a different model for
the Read. So you need to map the Read to the Update model before you can populate the controls…
Or you need to also create a Get for the Update model. Either way, yes, you’ll need to write more code.</p>

<p>(perhaps I can’t pin the next one entirely on CQRS but there is no stopping now 🔨 🔨 🔨)</p>

<p>For simple entities we obviously need to only fetch what we really need on the frontend. So
we create a <code>ListModel</code> and an <code>FullModel</code>. When we need to show just a few fields, we also
create a <code>HeaderModel</code> and a <code>ModalModel</code>. Since you’re not using GraphQL, each of these
also needs a backend endpoint and suddenly we also need to write some more code:
A <code>ListModelRequest</code>, <code>FullModelRequest</code> etc and their corresponding <code>ListModelRequestHandler</code> and <code>FullModelRequestHandler</code>.</p>

<p>But things get even better! We now have to keep all representations of the same entity
in sync. Alternatively we fetch when needed and discard from memory as soon as possible, for
example when the entity is no longer visible to the user. The amazing part is that now, we are
probably fetching more data compared to the single entity approach - which was probably the main
reason for having multiple representations in the first place.</p>

<p>Additionally it becomes harder to reuse components. Yeah, I would really like to use
the cool <code>ModalModelPopupComponent</code> but what I have is a <code>ListModel</code> and the <code>ModalModel</code> doesn’t have
that one property. The horror!</p>

<p><br />
<em>Disclaimer</em>: as always, “<a href="https://codepen.io/rachsmith/details/YweZbG/">it depends</a>”: for entities with many children it might be too heavy
to work with just one representation. <small>(each heading should probably have a disclaimer)</small></p>

<h2 id="the-search-for-answers">The Search For Answers</h2>

<p>The search for answers <strong>to the wrong question</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I keep this CRUD application easy to understand and modify while also applying CQRS?<br />
— <em>Every developer working on a CQRS + CRUD app</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you want to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, one searches for solutions.</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/CQRS-Ramble-Keeping-DRY.jpeg" alt="Keeping Oneself DRY" /></p>

<h3 id="domain-inheritance">Domain Inheritance</h3>

<p>The inevitable happens. In order to somewhat mitigate the maintainability issues
that arise from applying CQRS when it really shouldn’t, inheritance is used so that each
time a property changes, is removed or added, it doesn’t result in doing the same change
x times.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">class CreateUserRequest {
    string Name;
    DateTime BirthDate;
    Address Address;
}

class UpdateUserRequest : CreateUserRequest {
    int Id;
}

class FullUserViewModel : UpdateUserRequest {
    // perhaps this one is a stretch 😅
    DateTime CreatedOn;
    string CreatedBy;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The most striking, but perhaps also a non-issue, is that this is a Liskov Substitution Principle violation.
Your <code>CreateUserRequestHandler</code> is going to accept the <code>UpdateUserRequest</code> but it will probably not do what you’d
hope. A non issue because the execution chain is probably auto-wired.</p>

<p>Then there is reduced readability: in order to see what an entity contains you need to drill down the inheritance
chain and puzzle it together mentally.</p>

<p>So we are back to copy/paste? Now it’s reduced maintainability: all property changes need to be done x times.
And 🎉, most maintenance includes exactly that: add this one field, rename that field, delete that field.
Even in-code class and property documentation needs to be duplicated.</p>

<h3 id="generic-base-classes">Generic Base Classes</h3>

<p>The next source of repetition needs to go and so a well intended developer creates generic base classes to avoid
request handler code duplication.</p>

<p>We end up with the same amount of “Handlers” but now they do not contain any code
they only inherit a base, provide some options with generic parameters and a have constructor passing
a bunch of dependencies. The same may happen at every layer / branch in the application.</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">class CreateModelHandlerBase&lt;TReadModel, TCreateModel, TUpdateModel, TReturnModel&gt; {
    constructor(
        IRepository&lt;TReadModel, TCreateModel, TUpdateModel&gt;,
        IUnitOfWork&lt;TCreateModel&gt;,
        ITranslator,
        IErrorHandler,
        ILogger&lt;TCreateModel&gt;,
        IAuditor,
        IReferenceDataProvider,
        IUserProvider,
        ILanguageProvider,
        IHopeIMNotMissingOne
    ) {}

    DoIt(model): TReturnModel {
        // lots of crazy code here
        // it probably handles all

</code></pre>

<p>Yeah you don’t really need the Read/Update models for a CreateHandlerBase but
unfortunately the IRepository needed it. The TReadModel is first because the
same order of generic parameters is used in the Read, Update and Delete handlers
due to some nasty copy paste errors in the past.</p>

<h5 id="how-to-recognize-such-class">How to recognize such class</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Lot’s of generic parameters</li>
  <li>Zero documentation</li>
  <li>Already contains <code>if (model is Model5Request)</code> branches.</li>
  <li>No unit tests</li>
  <li>Seems to work but only its creator knows how</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, perhaps I can’t be too mad about this one, everyone probably ends up
with something similar for a CRUD persistence layer using either architecture.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-more-code-even-be-bad">Why would more code even be bad</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1.<br />
— <em>Robert C. Martin</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you have a code base that is x times the size of what it could be
you’ll now spend much more time on what you’re already doing most?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You would naturally expect a project that’s twice as large as another to have
twice as many errors. But the density of defects — the number of defects per 1000
lines of code — increases.<br />
— <em>Steve McConnell (Code Complete, “How Program Size Affects Construction”)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>More code === More bugs 😃</p>

<h3 id="accidental-complexity-vs-essential-complexity">Accidental Complexity vs Essential Complexity</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">Essential Complexity</a> is driven by
business needs and cannot be avoided.<br />
Accidental Complexity is what we are creating here: More types to create and
maintain. Arguably, a more difficult to follow flow of execution. More code to
read/scan through during bug hunting.</p>

<p>Not everyone in the team will have worked with CQRS. There is a learning curve. During an initial adjustment period
less value will be delivered.</p>

<p>Adding Accidental Complexity may be a good thing, but what are you buying yourself here?
What did applying CQRS bring to table that starts really paying off months/years later?</p>

<h2 id="freedom-or-enslavement">Freedom or Enslavement</h2>

<p>For those of you who have not yet noticed, what bothers me most about CQRS is that for everything
you do, it always means more code, usually in the form of new classes.</p>

<p>And isn’t that exactly what the Open-Closed Principle advocates? Well yes… true… I rest my case,
all hail CQRS.</p>

<p><br />
If the most common types of feature requests can be handled in an Open-Closed way, then 👍 for the team!
Unfortunately for CQRS this is only the case when creating new Entities or new ways to Create/Update existing entities.
Even long before you’ve gotten to 🎺 🎉 v1 🎉 🎺, no more new entities will be added and since it’s still very much a CRUD
application you most often end up with “Please add field x to entity y” tickets which is something
CQRS isn’t very good at.</p>

<p>So what is one to do?</p>

<h3 id="kiss">KISS</h3>

<p>If the only difference between create and update is the availability of the <code>id</code> property,
instead of literally writing/copying hundreds of lines of code, you can solve the issue
with no more than about 2 lines of code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">if (isCreate &amp;&amp; entity.id)
    throw Error;
</code></pre>

<p>If there is more to it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add the second if!</li>
  <li>How about <code>if (isUpdate) doThatOtherStuff();</code>?</li>
  <li>Add metadata to properties signaling “allow edit on create only” and other things happening in your domain.</li>
  <li>Introduce a seam</li>
  <li>Be creative! Injectors, Interceptors, Filters!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-cqrs-rule-of-thumb">A CQRS Rule of Thumb</h3>

<p>An easy to follow checklist to determine if you need CQRS for this upcoming “MetaDataAdmin” project:</p>

<p>If, for a single entity, your UX designer</p>

<p>OR: created 1 wireframe for Create, Read and Update<br />
OR: made one wireframe for each but they look pretty much alike<br />
<strong>THEN</strong>: Choose CQRS at your own peril.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>If he made 7 radically different wireframes: 2 Creates, 3 Updates and 2 Reads - for the same entity.<br />
<strong>THEN</strong>: I suggest you consider CQRS, it might be a good fit.</p>

<h3 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h3>

<p>If despite all this, it is CQRS or the highway:</p>

<p>Create code snippets, perhaps even a little generator to mitigate the pain. (you mean, write even more code? 😀)</p>

<p>Good documentation would help a lot but well, you know how it goes 😃</p>

<p>A simple diagram explaining the flow for a typical CRUD operation:
where in the project folder structure to create which class goes a long way
getting new devs and juniors onboard.</p>

<p>If you end up using the domain inheritance thing, (generated?) printouts
for the important entity types so you can piece things together more easily are a good
workaround for properties being “all over the place”.</p>

<p>UnitTest the heck out of those pretty “BaseHandlers” and you’ll be fine!</p>

<p><small>Or, you know, just abstract it away with a pretty meta-CQRS-CRUD design ;)</small></p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<!-- !Safely in comment! -->
<!--   CQRS === The 😈   -->

<p><a href="https://itenium.be/blog/productivity/pragmatic-tip-2-think-about-your-work/">THINK!</a> Does it make sense to use CQRS or not!?</p>

<p>If so, will it be helpful to do for all parts of the application and for all entities?</p>

<h3 id="the-cure-is-worse-than-the-disease">The Cure Is Worse Than The Disease</h3>

<p>If you are using CQRS for a CRUDdy app, then you are basically avoiding issues like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a create, you cannot set the <code>id</code></li>
  <li>For create and update, you cannot set audit fields (Create &amp; Update meta info)</li>
  <li>Sometimes, for some entities there are some fields that can only be set during Create or Update</li>
</ul>

<p>And replacing them with issues like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(Junior) Developers that have to learn this whole CQRS thing</li>
  <li>An explosion of classes and duplication (mappers, entities, dtos, requests, …)</li>
  <li>More expensive maintenance for CRUD-related feature requests</li>
  <li>You are making your application Open-Closed in all the wrong ways</li>
  <li>Developers that do not like duplication search for solutions
    <ul>
      <li>Domain classes that inherit from each other</li>
      <li>Empty classes that just inherit from another class</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>]]></block2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pragmatic Tip 22:
The editor should be an extension of your hand;
make sure your editor is configurable, extensible,
and programmable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a long time Sublime user, the infrequent updates and missing support for new-ish stuff
started to become quite apparent. Like all plugin maintainers have turned to Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p>And so I finally decided to leave Sublime Text 3 behind. Welcome Visual Studio Code, the new goto editor.</p>]]></excerpt>

<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>

<p>The main reason for the migration was the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode">VSCode Marketplace</a>.
Sublime still can’t handle the React Fragment <code>&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;</code> syntax. And this one
project I used Vue on, well… the VSCode plugins were just superb while ST3 failed me again.</p>

<p>Usually all you have to do is open a new file extension and VSCode will jump to the opportunity
to have you install yet a few more extensions 😃</p>

<div style="display: block">
			<kbd>Control</kbd>
				+
			<kbd>Shift</kbd>

			<kbd>X</kbd>: Search Extensions in Marketplace
</div>

<p>The builtin search functionality is pretty slick. You will usually be able to find what you want.
Type a <code>@</code> to get a list of filters on category, enabled/disabled, recommended, to sort etc.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vetur">Vetur</a> only comes up at #7 when searching for “Vue” but
soars the skies when searching for <code>vue @sort:installs</code>.</p>

<p>Find your newly installed extension with <code>Control Shift P</code>.
All its settings now show up in your <code>defaultSettings.json</code>.
A ⚙ (Gears) appears in the Side Bar after installation below the ⭐ (Stars) of the installed extension.
Click to configure it :)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Very glad I made the switch. It was quite the effort but I’m pretty content already.
Still need to configure linting, formatting, languages setup and also fix the occasional
kink in my setup but the overall experience is already way beyond Sublime Text.</p>

<p>Aside from being a pretty great IDE out of the box, it’s the plugins that really make VSCode shine.
Not only the quality offered but also the ease of actually finding them in the marketplace and their
configuration afterwards.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 32px; font-size: 23px;"><strong>Final score</strong>: 👍 👍 👍 🌈 🌈</p>

or a dying community, it will be for an editor that will (hopefully!) outlive them all,
you know, something like Vim.</p>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p class="hide-from-excerpt">This is what usually is the very first blog post. With links to some new-old posts, migrated from my 2012 blog.</p>

<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="personal-reference-bliki">Personal Reference Bliki</h2>

<p>Everyone who has worked with me for a while knows I’m really hyped about the
Pragmatic Programmers. My original idea back in 2012 was to blog about their
pragmatic tips, but this blog has instead turned into more of a “personal reference bliki”.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h5 id="reference">Reference</h5>

<p>Turns out I usually blog about a framework or library that I learned and basically wrote
as short a version of their documentation as possible, trying to let the code speak
for itself and resorting to text only for things that cannot be expressed as code
more succinctly.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://momentjs.com">Moment.js</a> library is used in many a project but
each time I needed something I hadn’t done in a while I had to revert to their docs.
Their documentation is great but I usually need to know only that one small thing.
Our <a href="https://itenium.be/blog/javascript/momentjs/">Moment.js blog post</a>
is about 10 pages and it covers, in pretty much the same detail, 80 pages of the 
<a href="http://momentjs.com/docs/">official docs</a>.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h5 id="bliki">Bliki</h5>

<p>Blog posts might be updated later on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To fix typos, broken code or add links</li>
  <li>Update things if they no longer hold true</li>
  <li>To reflect changes in the API after a major release of the library</li>
  <li>As I learn more about the subject</li>
  <li>To add more/less context</li>
  <li>Or… When I changed my mind about something :)</li>
</ul>

<p>The name shamelessly stolen from <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler’s bliki</a>.</p>

<h5 id="personal">Personal</h5>

<p>Some blog posts are used for me to link to avoid
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don’t Repeat Yourself</a>.
Instead of doing the full detailing once again, I try to coerce my colleagues
to the relevant blog post instead.</p>

<p>But most are basically to force myself to read the docs and/or revert to when
I pick up a project that is using a library I haven’t used in a while.</p>

<p>PS: There is a <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition">The Pragmatic Programmer 20th Anniversary Edition</a>
coming up. I should probably pre-order.</p>

<p>Do I still stand by it after 7 years?
Pretty much. There wasn’t anything I thought I should <strong>really</strong> remove so there’s that.
Should I write now on those two tips, I do think the articles would turn out radically different though :)</p>

<p>The second post ends with <em>Next up is “Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses”, one of my favorite tips!</em><br />

<p>A ramble against objects containing <code>DateStart</code> &amp; <code>DateEnd</code> pairs of properties.</p>

<p>Some of their equally evil relatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>DateStart</code> &amp; <code>TimeSpan</code> or <code>Day/Month only in DateTime</code>, etc.</li>
  <li><code>decimal Money</code> &amp; <code>string Currency</code></li>
  <li><code>decimal X/Y</code> and/or <code>Width/Height</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the case for the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html"><strong>ValueObject</strong></a>:</p>

      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="basic-example">Basic Example</h2>

<p>Consider the following class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c#">class Person {
    public string FirstName;
    public string LastName;
    public string Initials;
    public string Address;
    public string Street;
    public int HouseNumber;
    public string Telephone;
    public string Mobile;
    public string Email;
    public string WorkAddress;
    public string WorkStreet;
    public string WorkHouseNumber;
    public DateTime ActiveStart;
    public DateTime? ActiveEnd;
    // ... and many more?
}
</code></pre>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>And how beautiful it could’ve been:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c#">class Person {
    // The first version was quite obfuscated, while in this version it's
    // quite obvious what's in it by merely glancing at the declaration.
    public Name Name;
    public Contact Contact;
    public Address HomeAddress;
    public Address WorkAddress;
    public DateRange Active;
}

class Name {
    // Please don't repeat the Name for each property here
    // Considering the current class, we know the context!
    public string First;
    public string Last;
    public string Initials;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<h5 id="for-the-ide">For the IDE</h5>

<p>Instead of a long list of properties that may be difficult to navigate in your IDE,
where it is difficult to spot that one property you need,
one could instead split it up in things that logically belong together to keep intellisense small and focused.<br />
Keep data that belongs together - together!</p>

<h5 id="for-the-ui">For the UI</h5>

<p>Such stuff is usually displayed together. All the way down to the frontend, passing
an <code>Address</code> to an <code>AddressComponent</code> is very preferable over passing those properties
in separately.</p>

<h5 id="for-expressiveness">For Expressiveness</h5>

<p>Without our precious <code>ValueObject</code>, we would end up creating all sorts of helper classes
for often sought after functionality, all scattered around the codebase, some perhaps
getting duplicated by different programmers or even for different UserStories.</p>

<p>Some of these helper methods would be much better off being members of a <code>ValueObject</code>
instead. We get better IDE discoverability and rather than having to pass some or all properties of an entity into an algorithm,
we invoke a well-named method on the ValueObject in true <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html">TellDontAsk</a> style.</p>

<p>And isn’t that what Object Oriented Design is all about? 😇</p>

<h2 id="recognition">Recognition</h2>

<p>If you look, <code>ValueObject</code> opportunities will present themselves.</p>

<h3 id="technical-valueobjects">Technical ValueObjects</h3>

<p>Classes are very technical in nature and so there’ll be purely technical candidates
like, for example, a (still?) popular one:<br />
<code>CreatedOn + CreatedBy</code> and <code>UpdatedOn + UpdatedBy</code>.<br />
Why clutter (all) your entities with 4 superfluous properties if you can hide them behind
a single <code>Audit</code> ValueObject?</p>

<h3 id="domain-valueobjects">Domain ValueObjects</h3>

<p>It is the <code>ValueObjects</code> derived from the Business Domain that often offer the
most value however. Helper functions for a <code>DateRange</code> only go as long as a <code>IsIn(DateTime)</code>.
For Domain ValueObjects, this can be whatever rabbit Marketing pulls out of their hat
depending on the current lunar phase, so the possibilities are endless!</p>

<h4 id="not-invented-here-syndrome">Not Invented Here Syndrome</h4>

<p>I never thought I’d ever say this: Do not use a package. Yes, there is that well-known and fully-fledged <code>DateRange</code> package out there.
80% of its features are probably not useful for your problem domain though. Again you get a long list of methods that basically
clutter your IDE. Super handy features that are applicable only in your domain will most likely not be available, as your business
probably has very particular requirements.</p>

<h4 id="business-domain-example">Business Domain Example</h4>

<pre><code class="language-c#">// A domain where we work with measured stuff
class MeasurementResults {
    public decimal Value1;
    public int Value1Precision;
    public decimal Value2;
    public int Value2Precision;
    public decimal Value3;
    public int Value3Precision;
}

// Could be turned into
class MeasurementResults {
    public Measurement Result1;
    public Measurement Result2;
    public Measurement Result3;
}

class Measurement {
    public decimal Value;
    public int Precision;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="random-thoughts">Random Thoughts</h2>

<h5 id="the-true-enemy">The True Enemy?</h5>

<p>Well I guess that missing <code>ValueObjects</code> are often an unfortunate side-effect of using a relational database.
Your SQL database simply likes things flat. Your ORM probably has something like Custom Types (Hibernate), 
Complex Types (EF) or Owned Entities (EF Core). If you use an ORM it can probably do the ValueObject creation
for you.</p>

<h5 id="derive-dont-store">Derive, Don’t Store</h5>

<p>If you can calculate something from existing state, do so.
Once stored separately, it will, at some point be out of sync, I guarantee it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">class Person {
    public string FirstName;
    public string LastName;

    // This simply does not get out of sync
    // Otherwise each day is trying to remember if the
    // FullName starts or ends with the FirstName
    // +You have less state to manage, so hurray!
    public string FullName =&gt; $"{FirstName} {LastName}";
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Not creating a value object for coherent pairs of value types is a missed opportunity? 😂</p>]]></block2>

<ul>
  <li>Default grid for 1v1: 800x600</li>
  <li>Time is measured in ticks = turns.</li>
  <li>1 distance unit = 1 pixel unless the game scaled down the battlefield to fit on the screen.</li>
  <li>Acceleration (a): Robots accelerate at 1px/turn and decelerate at 2px/turn.</li>
  <li>Velocity (v): Max: 8px/turn. The robot movies in the direction of the <code>GunHeading</code>.</li>
  <li>Distance (d): distance = velocity * time.</li>

      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-robot">The Robot</h2>

<p>A Robot consists of:</p>

<h3 id="body">Body</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>Energy</code>:
    <ul>
      <li>Start with 100.</li>
      <li>Drops when firing, getting hit, running into robots or walls and being inactive</li>
      <li>At 0, it is game over!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>Ahead(double distance)</code> &amp; <code>Back</code>: Distance in pixels.
    <ul>
      <li>Collision with another robot: 0.6 energy damage</li>
      <li>Collision with a wall <code>abs(velocity) * 0.5 - 1 (never &lt; 0)</code> (AdvancedRobot only)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>Velocity</code>: Measured in pixels/turn. Max: 8px/turn. Accelerate: 1px/turn. Decelerate: 2px/turn.</li>
  <li><code>TurnLeft(double degrees)</code> &amp; <code>TurnRight</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Maximum rate of rotation is <code>(10 - 0.75 * abs(velocity)) deg/turn</code>.</li>
      <li>The faster you’re moving, the slower you turn.</li>
      <li><code>Heading</code>: Direction the tank is facing. Returns 0 to 360 (exclusive). 0 is North. 90 is East etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>Width</code> &amp; <code>Height</code>: Dimensions of the Robot. (36x36)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gun">Gun</h3>

<p>Pew! Pew! Pew!!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mounted on the Body.</li>
  <li><code>GunHeat</code>:
    <ul>
      <li>Can only <code>Fire</code> when this is zero.</li>
      <li>Each turn the Gun cools with <code>GunCoolingRate</code>. Default: 0.1 / turn.</li>
      <li>At game start <code>GunHeat</code> is 3.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>Fire</code> &amp; <code>FireBullet(double power): Bullet</code>:
    <ul>
      <li>With <code>power</code> between 0.1 and 3.</li>
      <li>Costs <code>power</code> amount of <code>energy</code>. If power &gt; energy, you become disabled.</li>
      <li>Damage: <code>(4 * power)</code>. If power &gt; 1, an additional <code>2 * (power - 1)</code> damage.</li>
      <li>If hit, you regain <code>(3 * power)</code> worth of <code>energy</code>.</li>
      <li><code>GunHeat</code> increases with <code>1 + (power / 5)</code>.</li>
      <li>Generates <code>onBullHit</code>, <code>onBulletHitBullet</code> and <code>onBulletMissed</code> events.</li>
      <li>Bullets move with a velocity of <code>20 - (3 * power)</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>turnGunLeft</code> and <code>turnGunRight</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>The maximum rate of rotation is: 20 deg/turn.</li>
      <li><code>GunHeading</code>: Direction the gun is facing. Returns 0 to 360 (exclusive). 0 is North. 90 is East etc.</li>
      <li><code>IsAdjustGunForRobotTurn</code>: True = Guns turns separately of Body.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="radar">Radar</h3>

<p>Scans for other robots.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mounted on the Gun.</li>
  <li><code>turnRadarLeft(double degrees)</code> and <code>turnRadarRight</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>The maximum rate of rotation is: 45 deg/turn</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Generates <code>onScannedRobot</code> events when another robot is detected.</li>
  <li><code>RadarHeading</code>: Direction the radar is facing.</li>
  <li><code>IsAdjustRadarForGunTurn</code>: True = Radar turns separately of Gun.</li>
  <li><code>IsAdjustRadarForRobotTurn</code>: True = Radar turns separately of Body.</li>

      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="install-robocode">Install Robocode</h2>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Java JDK 6+</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/robocode/1.9.3.3/">robocode-1.9.3.3-setup.jar</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Or follow the official <a href="http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/System_Requirements">step by step instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you get a <em>“‘java’ is not recognized as an internal or external command”</em>, then
<a href="http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/System_Requirements#Setting_environmental_variables_on_Windows">add your JDK to PATH</a>.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="building-a-robot">Building a Robot</h2>

<h3 id="in-the-robocode-ui">In the Robocode UI</h3>

<p>Robot &gt; Source Editor (Control + E) &gt; New Robot (Control + N)</p>

<p>This will generate something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class MyRobot extends Robot
{
    public void run() {
        setColors(Color.red, Color.blue, Color.green); // body, gun, radar

        while(true) {
            ahead(100); // pixels
            turnGunRight(360); // degrees
            back(100);
            turnGunRight(360);
        }
    }

    public void onScannedRobot(ScannedRobotEvent e) {
        fire(1); // Strength between 0.1 and 3.0
    }

    public void onHitByBullet(HitByBulletEvent e) {
        back(10);
    }
    
    public void onHitWall(HitWallEvent e) {
        back(20);
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p>Extend either <code>Robot</code> or <code>AdvancedRobot</code>. An AdvancedRobot:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loses energy when bumping into walls.</li>
  <li>Can have non-blocking calls (<code>setXXX() methods</code>), custom events and FileSystem access.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are ready for battle, use: Compiler &gt; Compile (Control + B) in the Source Editor.</p>

<h3 id="in-eclipse">In Eclipse</h3>

<p>New Project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Libraries &gt; Add External JARs…: Add <code>libs/robocode.jar</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>External annotations &gt; Edit: Javadoc is bundled with Robocode.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do not create a <code>module-info.java</code>.</li>
  <li>Add a new Java Class with Superclass: <code>robocode.Robot</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure your final robot is <a href="http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Package_Robot">packaged</a>!
A <code>*</code> appears in-game next to a robot’s name if it is a development version.</p>

<h5 id="robocode-ui">Robocode UI</h5>

<p>Add the project’s <code>bin</code> folder in the Robocode UI:<br />
Options &gt; Preferences &gt; Development Options &gt; Add</p>

<h4 id="debugging">Debugging</h4>

<p>Run as &gt; Run configurations &gt; Java Application</p>

<ul>
  <li>Main class: <code>robocode.Robocode</code></li>
  <li>Arguments &gt; VM arguments: <code>-Xmx512M -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false -Ddebug=true</code></li>
  <li>Arguments &gt; Working directory &gt; Other &gt; Robocode install path (ex: c:\robocode)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not point to a Robocode directory where the .NET plug-in is also installed!</p>

<h3 id="in-visual-studio">In Visual Studio</h3>

<p>Download the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/robocode/1.9.3.3/">.NET plug-in for Robocode</a> 
and <strong>install in the same directory as Robocode itself</strong>!</p>

<p>Create a .NET Framework project and reference <code>libs\robocode.dll</code>.
See <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/Robocode"><code>dotnet-bots</code></a> for a minimal example.</p>

<h5 id="robocode-ui-1">Robocode UI</h5>

<p>Add the <code>bin\Debug</code> folder in the Robocode UI:<br />
Options &gt; Preferences &gt; Development Options &gt; Add</p>

<p><a href="http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/.NET/Create_a_.NET_robot_with_Visual_Studio">Wiki</a></p>

<h4 id="debugging-1">Debugging</h4>

<p>Project &gt; Properties &gt; Debug:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start external program: <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_211\bin\java.exe</code></li>
  <li>Command line arguments:
    <pre><code>-Ddebug=true -Xmx512M -cp libs/robocode.jar;libs/jni4net.j-0.8.7.0.jar -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions "--add-opens=java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.jar=ALL-UNNAMED" "--add-opens=java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED" "--add-opens=java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED" robocode.Robocode
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Working directory: Where installed (ex: c:\robocode)</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure your final robot is a <code>Release</code> build!</p>

<p><a href="http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/.NET/Debug_a_.NET_robot_in_Visual_Studio">Wiki</a></p>

<h2 id="more-debugging">More Debugging</h2>

<p>Start Robocode UI in debug mode:<br />
<code>java -Ddebug=true -Xmx512M ...</code><br />
Find the CLI arguments in <code>robocode.bat</code>.</p>

<h5 id="robot-console">Robot Console</h5>

<p>See <code>out.println()</code> (or <code>Console.WriteLine()</code>) in your robot log by clicking on your robot name in the right top battle
view pane in the UI. SYSTEM events and crash stack traces will also be printed in the robot console.</p>]]></block2>

      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="builtin-functionality">Builtin functionality</h2>

<h3 id="msgbox">MsgBox</h3>

<p>MsgBox pauses the current thread so you can use “other debugging tools”
while displaying something.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">var := 10
vas := 5
MsgBox aaargh %var%
MsgBox % var "and" vas
</code></pre>

<h5 id="tooltip">Tooltip</h5>

<p><a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/ToolTip.htm"><code>Tooltip</code></a> 
creates a non-blocking, always-on-top window anywhere on the screen.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">Tooltip [, Text`nMoreText, X, Y, WhichTooltip]
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>If Text is omitted, the tooltip is hidden.</li>
  <li>If X &amp; Y are omitted, the tooltip is displayed near the mouse cursor.</li>
  <li>X &amp; Y are relative to the active window. Use <a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/CoordMode.htm"><code>CoordMode</code></a> to display somewhere else.</li>
  <li>WhichTooltip: A number between 1-20 to control multiple tooltips.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<p>I’ll be honest, they are not the prettiest tools in the shed.
They do come in handy from time to time and 
are available from the default tray icon menu.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/KeyHistory.htm"><code>KeyHistory</code></a>: Unsure how to bind a certain key/mouse button? Use this tool!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/ListVars.htm"><code>ListVars</code></a>: Lists all variable names with content. Good for primitives (ie: an Array displays <code>Object object {address: 0x5B2AD0}</code>).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/ListLines.htm"><code>ListLines</code></a>: Script lines most recently executed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/ListHotkeys.htm"><code>ListHotkeys</code></a>: Very crude listing of all registered hotkeys.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scripts to <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=9656&amp;p=248727">retrieve and parse the output for these windows</a>.</p>

<h4 id="window-spy">Window Spy</h4>

<p>Activate scripts only in certain contexts with <code>IfWinActive</code>. 
But how to determine this <code>ahk_class</code> thingy?</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; Esc twice to open/close DevTools... But only in Chrome
#IfWinActive, ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin
~Esc::
If (A_PriorHotKey = A_ThisHotKey and A_TimeSincePriorHotkey &lt; 500)
    Send {F12}
Return
#IfWinActive
</code></pre>

<p>To figure that out (and much more!), bundled with Autohotkey comes the immensely useful
utility Window Spy (usually called <code>AU3_Spy.exe</code>). It’s also available from
the tray menu.</p>

<h3 id="warnings">Warnings</h3>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; Default: Disable all warnings.
#Warn All, Off

; Every warning in a MsgBox.
#Warn

; Warn when a local variable is used before it's set in OutputDebug.
#Warn UseUnsetLocal, OutputDebug
</code></pre>

<p>Warning Types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UseUnsetLocal and UseUnsetGlobal</li>
  <li>LocalSameAsGlobal</li>
  <li>ClassOverwrite</li>
  <li>UseEnv: Warn when a variable used has the same name as an environment variable. 
To avoid this confusion, start with <a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/NoEnv.htm"><code>#NoEnv</code></a> and
use <a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/EnvGet.htm"><code>EnvGet</code></a>
/ <a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/EnvSet.htm"><code>EnvSet</code></a> for interacting with
environment variables instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outputdebug">OutputDebug</h3>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">OutputDebug, Value of %var%
</code></pre>

<p>If the script’s process has no debugger, the system debugger displays the string.
Follow <code>OutputDebug</code> with, for example DebugView (<code>Dbgview.exe</code>) 
from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/">Sysinternals</a>.</p>

<h3 id="suspension">Suspension</h3>

<h4 id="pause">Pause</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Pause.htm"><code>Pause</code></a> will toggle the current thread.
Hotstrings and Hotkeys will still run.
<code>A_IsPaused</code> contains the pause state of the underlying thread.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; Freezes the current thread with Windows + Pause
#Pause::Pause, On
; Also: Off and Toggle (default)

<h4 id="suspend">Suspend</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Suspend.htm"><code>Suspend</code></a> will enable/disable all hotkeys and hotstrings.
<code>A_IsSuspended</code> contains the script suspension state.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">^#Pause::

<p>By default the script can also be paused/suspended via its <a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Menu.htm#Icon">tray icon menu</a>
and a different tray icon is shown when toggled. Nothing is worse as you thinking
your code doesn’t work as expected when its not even running :)</p>

<h4 id="exit--exitapp">Exit &amp; ExitApp</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/_Persistent.htm"><code>#Persistent</code></a> directive
will make a script not directly <code>Exit</code> after the auto-execute section. <code>Exit</code> merely 
exits the current thread. Use <code>ExitApp</code> to close the script completely.</p>

<p>A script is automatically persistent when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It has defined hotkeys or hotstrings</li>
  <li>It sets NumLock, ScrollLock or CapsLock AlwaysOn or AlwaysOff</li>
</ul>

<p>Use <code>#Persistent</code> when you do not have any of the above but you do have timers or custom menu items.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; Control + Win + Alt + Pause: Emergency exit

Provides a drop-in replacement: Whatever you wrote, it should just work on the web.
It emulates OpenGL, the FileSystem etc.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="for-web-developers">For Web Developers</h2>

<p>Two main use cases</p>
<ul>
  <li>Surgical replacement of tiny modules in your JavaScript, the hot paths, the bottlenecks, with WebAssembly</li>
  <li>Use existing libraries that do not exist on npm from another ecosystem (C/C++, Rust, …)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-performance-myth">The Performance Myth</h2>

<p>WebAssembly and JavaScript both have the same peak performance. But…
JavaScript can easily fall off the “fast path” while WebAssembly will not.</p>

<figure class="imagewrapper" style="max-width: 700px">
    <img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/webassembly-v8-js-vs-wasm.png" alt="" title="" class="img-responsive" />

    
    <figcaption>Inside V8</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<ul>
  <li><code>js</code> input
    <ul>
      <li>Ignition: Interprets the JS text and runs it. While running, collects analytics data about how the code is behaving before TurboFan kicks in.</li>
      <li>TurboFan: The optimizing compiler.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>wasm</code> input
    <ul>
      <li>Liftoff: The streaming WebAssembly compiler which generates machine code.</li>
      <li>TurboFan: The optimizing compiler which generates optimized code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With JavaScript input, TurboFan will deopt (deoptimization) when
the assumptions from the collected analytics no longer hold true
reverting back to the Ignition interpreter.
With Liftoff you always stay on the fast path.</p>

<p><strong>WebAssembly delivers more predictable performance than JavaScript</strong></p>

<h5 id="webassembly-threads-and-simd">WebAssembly Threads and SIMD</h5>

<p>Will allow WebAssembly to outperform JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shared Linear Memory</li>
  <li>Atomic operations</li>
  <li>Implemented with WebWorkers</li>
  <li>Ships with Chrome 74</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="host-bindings">Host bindings</h5>

<!-- IDL: Interface Description Language -->
<p>Interact easily with JavaScript and DOM objects with the <strong>Web IDL interface</strong>.
Will also greatly reduce the glue overhead that is currently required.</p>

        🚀 Testing can be a drag. AVA helps you get it done.</p>

<p><br />
A concurrent test runner from the Andromeda galaxy. If I was to stray from 
<a href="https://itenium.be/blog/javascript/javascript-testing-jasmine-getting-started/">Jasmine</a> then it could only 
be for a project <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">Sindre Sorhus</a> is working on :)
The screenshots on the project site promised extensive assertion failure output with clean stack traces
and built-in Promise, async/await, Observable and React component support.
So I tried it out and yup, AVA delivered.</p>

    t.is(value, expected); // Object.is() comparison
    t.not(value, expected); // Inverted t.is()

<h2 id="reactivity">Reactivity</h2>

<h5 id="array">Array</h5>

<p>Vue.js has wrapped array functions so that they are reactive:<br />
<code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>unshift</code>, <code>splice</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>reverse</code></p>

<p>Assigning a new array will reuse DOM elements if possible on the re-render.</p>

<p>It <strong>will not detect <code>this.items[0] = 'newVal'</code></strong>. If you must, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Vue.set(vm.items, indexOfItem, newValue);
vm.items.splice(indexOfItem, 1, newValue);
vm.$set(vm.items, indexOfItem, newValue);
</code></pre>

<h5 id="objects">Objects</h5>

<p>Assigning a new property to an object is not reactive.
Assign it a default value on initialization.</p>

<p>If you must, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Vue.set(vm.userProfile, 'age', 27);
vm.$set(vm.userProfile, 'age', 27);
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>I was really surprised by Vue’s simplicity and terse syntax due its many shorthands.
Tooling in Visual Studio Code and Chrome is really good. The CLI was pretty amazing
at setting up a full blown starter project.</p>

<p>So, I learned me some Vue.js for a technical session
and am already set on using it for a few small projects.</p>]]></block2>

<p>Give yourself a moment</p>
<pre><code>npm install moment
</code></pre>

<h2 id="parse">Parse</h2>

<p>Many Moment functions accept a <code>moment-like</code> argument. Where moment-like is 
<code>Moment | String | Number | Date | Array | Object</code>.</p>

<h5 id="another-date">Another date</h5>
<p><code>moment(Date)</code> and <code>moment(Moment)</code> == <code>moment().clone()</code></p>

<h5 id="an-array">An array</h5>
<p><code>moment([year, month, day, hour, minute, second, ms])</code>.
Only year is required.
Mirrors date so <strong>month is zero indexed</strong>.
<code>moment().toArray()</code> returns this format.</p>

<h5 id="an-object">An object</h5>
<p><code>moment({year: 2010, month: 3, ...})</code> or just <code>moment({y: 1, M: 0, d: 1, h: 0, m: 0, s: 0, ms: 0})</code>.
Can provide <code>year</code>, <code>years</code> or <code>y</code>. Accepts numbers or strings. <code>date</code> is an additional alias for <code>day</code>.
Note a capital M for months and lowercase m for minutes.
<code>moment().toObject()</code> returns an object with plural key names (and <code>date</code>).</p>

<h5 id="a-number--unix-timestamp">A number / Unix timestamp</h5>
<ul>
  <li><code>moment(milliseconds)</code>.</li>
  <li><code>moment.unix(seconds).utc()</code>. Without <code>.utc()</code> will create a local date.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="partials">Partials</h5>
<p><code>moment('15', 'hh')</code> == today 15:00:00.000</p>

<h3 id="parse-strings">Parse strings</h3>

<p><code>moment(str)</code>
accepts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 dates</a>.
If you’re not using an ISO 8601 date string, provide the format
and turn off <code>forgiving mode</code> by passing true as the third argument.
Otherwise fallback to <code>new Date(str)</code> which has varying browser support.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Forgiving mode (default)
moment('01-01-2016', 'MM/DD/YYYY', false).format();
// --&gt; 2016-01-01T00:00:00-06:00

// Strict mode
moment('01-01-2016', 'MM/DD/YYYY', true).format();
// --&gt; Invalid date

// Forgiving is very forgiving
moment('2016 is a date', 'YYYY-MM-DD').isValid();
// --&gt; true because 2016 was matched
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>Also accepts an array for allowing multiple formats. First exact hit matches. Docs mention multiple formats is considerably slower.</li>
  <li>Third parameter true means <code>strict mode</code>. Otherwise <code>forgiving mode</code>.</li>
  <li>Third parameter could also be the locale ex <code>fr</code>. The fourth parameter is then the mode.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>git hooks</strong><br />
Run a program before certain points in gits execution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are defined in <code>.git\hooks</code>. <!-- (config: `core.hooksPath`) --><br />
You can find some example files in that directory. Remove their <code>.sample</code> suffix
to test them out.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="husky">Husky</h2>

<p>Hooks are saved locally and not pushed to the remote.
Husky allows you to easily make the git hooks part of the repository itself.</p>

<pre><code>npm install husky --save-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Add to <code>package.json</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-push": "bash prepush.sh",
      "pre-commit": "npm run lint"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It’s also possible to put the json (without the <code>husky</code> node)
in a <code>.huskyrc</code> or <code>.huskyrc.json</code> file.</p>

<h3 id="prepushsh">prepush.sh</h3>

<p>Prepush script that works around the frontend project <code>package.json</code> not being in the
root of the git repository.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/sh

# Path Juggling
originalPath=`pwd`
if [ "`git rev-parse --show-cdup`" != "" ]; then cd `git rev-parse --show-cdup`; fi
cd ./frontend-project-folder/

# Linting
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    cd $originalPath
    exit -1
fi

# Testing
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  cd $originalPath
  exit -1
fi

# Build
npm run build
hasBuildErrors=$?

cd $originalPath
exit $hasBuildErrors
</code></pre>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>More control with <code>.huskyrc.js</code> and environment variables.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const tasks = arr =&gt; arr.join(' &amp;&amp; ');

module.exports = {
  'hooks': {
    'pre-commit': tasks([
      'echo $HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS',

      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="splitting-repositories">Splitting Repositories</h2>

<p>You start with a small project. It grows over time as you add more and more features.
And then, at some point, you realize one of these features should actually
have been a separate repository because it provides functionality that can be useful
in multiple contexts.</p>

<p>So far I moved the files and did a <code>git init</code>. At this point, I was always sad
because well, I lost the history of the feature. Not only less
commits for my Github statistics but I also lost <code>git blame</code> so it could no longer
tell me why a particular algorithm was written the way it was.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>Turns out git allows you to have your cake and eat it too!</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># DEPRECATED!!
git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter src master
</code></pre>

<p>These days you get a deprecation warning when using <code>filter-branch</code>
and are pointed to a third party package instead:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">
    <a href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo" style="margin-right: 6px">
        <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/newren/git-filter-repo.svg?style=social&amp;label=Star" style="vertical-align: middle" />
    </a>
    <a href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo">newren/git-filter-repo</a>:
        Quickly rewrite git repository history (filter-branch replacement)</p>

<p><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/docs/html/git-filter-repo.html">git-filter-repo(1) docs</a></p>

<pre><code class="language-sh"># Requires git &gt;= 2.24.0 and Python &gt;= 3.5
pip3 install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo -h
git filter-repo --path src --subdirectory-filter src

# When you want to turn src/frontend into a new repository
git filter-repo --path src/frontend --path-rename src/frontend/:
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="locking-out-package-lockjson">Locking out package-lock.json</h2>

<p>These days each <code>npm install</code> makes a <code>git diff</code> on frontend projects a real drag.
Page upon page of uninteresting changes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git diff -- ':!*package-lock.json' ':!*yarn.lock'
</code></pre>

<p>Or as a <code>~/.gitconfig</code> alias:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">df = "!f() { git diff --ignore-all-space -- $1 ':(exclude)*yarn.lock' ':!**package-lock.json'; }; f"
</code></pre>

<p>Important note: If you use the <code>git df</code> alias, <code>git df package-lock.json</code> will <strong>never</strong> show anything.
You’ll have to use plain old <code>git diff</code> for checking the excluded files!</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="deleting-merged-branches">Deleting merged branches</h2>

<p><strong>Locally</strong>:<br />
<code>~/.gitconfig</code> aliases. <code>(develop|master)</code>: Do not delete these branches even if merged with current branch.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">merged-branches = !git branch --merged | egrep -v \"(\\*| ) (develop|master)\" | xargs -n 1
dm = !git merged-branches git branch -d
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Remote</strong>:</p>

<p>Somehow a CI server always seems to be amassing feature branches. A simple cleanup script to the rescue!</p>

<p>Replace <code>name-committer</code> (author filter) and <code>origin</code> (remote filter) and add as a <code>~/.gitconfig</code> alias:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">my-merged-remote-branches = !git for-each-ref --format='%(authorname):%(refname)' | egrep \"name-committer\" | egrep \"refs/remotes\" | sed -e \"s/^.*:refs\\/remotes\\/origin\\//:/\"
</code></pre>

<p>Followed by PowerShell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">git my-merged-remote-branches | % { git push --no-verify origin $_ }
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="filename-case-renaming">Filename case renaming</h2>

<p>Pesky Windows.<br />
Also note the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-coreignoreCase"><code>core.ignorecase</code></a> configuration value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git mv -f OldFileNameCase newfilenamecase
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="remapping-remote-urls">Remapping remote urls</h2>

<p>When the remote url changes for all your repositories.</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">$paths = Get-ChildItem "c:\git-repos" | ? { $_.PSIsContainer }
foreach ($path in $paths) {
    $gitPath = Join-Path $path.FullName "\.git"
    if (Test-Path -Path $gitPath -PathType Container) {
        Write-Host $path.FullName " -&gt; " $gitPath
        $url = "https://new-base-url.com/$($path.Name)"
        Write-Host "Remap to $url"
        Push-Location $path.FullName
        git remote set-url origin $url
        Write-Host " "
        Pop-Location
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="create-pr-in-browser">Create PR in browser</h2>

<p>From your current branch.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps1">function Create-PullRequest() {
  $baseUrl = git remote get-url origin

  if ($baseUrl -match 'github.com') {
    $urlTemplate += "{base-url}/compare/{target-branch}...{source-branch}"
  } else {

<p style="float: right"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test">RegExp.prototype.test</a></p>

<p>Returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const didMatch = /a/.test('abc');

<h3 id="stringprototypereplace">String.prototype.replace</h3>

<p style="float: right"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace">String.prototype.replace</a></p>

<p>Without the <code>g</code> flag, only the first match is replaced. (which makes no difference in the example:)<br />
ECMAScript2021 added <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll"><code>replaceAll</code></a>: you can now replace all occurrences without using a regex.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">'too  many  spaces'.replace(/  /g, ' ');
'too  many  spaces'.replaceAll('  ', ' ');

<h3 id="stringprototypematch">String.prototype.match</h3>

<p><strong>match() with the <code>g</code> flag</strong>:</p>

<p style="float: right"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match">String.prototype.match</a></p>

<p>Returns <code>null</code> or all matches as a <code>string[]</code>. There is no captured group info.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const match = 'a_ab_a'.match(/a(b?)/g);
expect(match).toEqual(['a', 'ab', 'a']);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>match() without the <code>g</code> flag</strong>:<br />
Returns <code>null</code> or the first match and its capturing groups.<br />
The result is an array with additional fields
(groups, index and input). <code>exec</code></p>

<p><small>(Hence the weird toEqual array syntax in the code below…)</small></p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const match = '0abaa'.match(/a(?&lt;theB&gt;b?)/);

    0: 'ab', // Entire matched string
    1: 'b',  // First captured group
    groups: {theB: 'b'}, // Results of named groups (ES2018)
    index: 1,
    input: '0abaa'
]);

// Without the g flag, match behaves exactly like exec:
const exec = /a(?&lt;theB&gt;b?)/.exec('0abaa');
expect(exec).toEqual(match);

<h3 id="regexpprototypeexec">RegExp.prototype.exec</h3>

<p style="float: right"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec">RegExp.prototype.exec</a></p>

<p>When you need the capturing groups of all matches, it’s <code>exec</code> to the rescue.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const globbing = /(a)(b2?)/g;
const input = 'ab_ab2';
// Indexes     0  3  

globbing.exec(input);
== Object.assign(['ab', 'a', 'b'], {index: 0});

globbing.exec(input);

globbing.exec(input);
== null

<p style="float: right"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/@@matchAll">RegExp.prototype.matchAll</a></p>

<p>Easier matching and grouping, plus avoiding the <code>while</code> loop necessary when using the “old” <code>exec</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const regex = /(a)(b2?)/g; // TypeError when not g(lobal)!
const result = 'ab_ab2'.matchAll(regex);

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="talk-to-the-duck">Talk to the Duck</h2>

<p>When confronted with a problem, don’t ask the person next to you for help right away,
he’s probably doing something important as well!</p>

<p>Instead, first tell the duck about it - out loud. If you don’t get to a solution,
start explaining your problem in more and more detail until it hits you.
If the mere explanation led to a solution, you avoid unwillingly 
turning your colleague into a <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?CardboardProgrammer">CardboardProgrammer</a>.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>Most likely the duck will just sit there and appear to have done exactly nothing.
Does it get satisfaction every time it assists someone in finding a solution? We will probably never know.</p>

<h2 id="more-frivolous">More Frivolous</h2>

<p>My family somehow turned Rubber Duck Debugging into “give Wouter as many ducks as humanly possible”.</p>

<p>The most magnificent duck I’ve received so far:</p>

<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>

<h3 id="pragmatic-programmers">Pragmatic Programmers</h3>

<p>The original idea was to blog about the Pragmatic Programmer Tips.
The blog turned out quite differently however. Still, here we are, Rubber
Duck Problem Solving, yet another thing I learned from the
Pragmatic Programmers.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Tip 3: Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses</strong><br />
Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can’t be done,
is late, or is broken, stop and listen to yourself. <strong>Talk to the rubber
duck</strong> on your monitor, or the cat. Does your excuse sound reasonable,
or stupid? How’s it going to sound to your boss? - <em>Andrew Hunt and David Thomas</em></p>

<p>One final tip (in this context!) from them pragmatic programmers: “<em>Don’t be afraid to ask, or to admit that you need help.</em>”
No one knows everything.</p>

<h3 id="coding-horror">Coding Horror</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The effort of walking an imaginary someone through your problem, step by step and in some detail, 
is what will often lead you to your answer.
… Even if you don’t get the answer you wanted, forcing yourself to fully explain your problem will 
frequently lead to new insights and discoveries. - <em>Jeff Atwood</em>
in <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/">CodingHorror - Rubber Duck Problem Solving</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>StackOverflow also did a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">April Fools’ Day joke</a> in 2018 
about this. Displaying a duck in the corner which, after some apparent thinking &amp; writing, produced a quack.</p>

<h3 id="wikiwikiweb">WikiWikiWeb</h3>

<p>At WikiwikiWeb they also have a <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?RubberDucking">RubberDucking</a> page.
They originally called it the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?CardboardProgrammer">CardboardProgrammer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’ve just spent the whole day trying to solve a problem, a design problem, a bug, etc. You know the solution is simple but you just can’t see it.</p>

  <p>A colleague walks past and notices your anguish: “What’s up?”.
“Oh, I’m …”. You explain the problem and what you have done so far. However you suddenly discover the solution before you have finished speaking! So far your colleague has been as useful as a cardboard cutout.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other, similar techniques:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ReflectiveArticulation">ReflectiveArticulation</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ThinkingOutLoud">ThinkingOutLoud</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?AskTheCode">AskTheCode</a> aka <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?UseTheSourceLuke">UseTheSourceLuke</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And to finish this post, a business idea from the RubberDucking wiki page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can even pair program with a rubber duck.<br />
It would be perfect if you added a little voice chip that asked, “<em>Did you write the test?</em>”</p>
</blockquote>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array"><code>Array.prototype</code></a> functions have been available for a long time but
it’s since <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">Arrow functions</a>
that “Linq lambda syntax”-like functionality is available in JavaScript.</p>

<p>This blog post explains the most common functions by comparing them to their C# equivalents.</p>

<p>A basic example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// JavaScript
const result = [0, 1, 2, 3, null]
    .filter(x =&gt; x !== null)
    .map(x =&gt; x * 10)
    .sort((a, b) =&gt; b - a);

expect(result).toEqual([30, 20, 10, 0]);

// C#
var result = new int?[] {0, 1, 2, 3, null}
    .Where(x =&gt; x != null)
    .Select(x =&gt; x * 10)
    .OrderByDescending(x =&gt; x)
    .ToArray();
</code></pre>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you want to write a <code>for</code> to loop over an array, the <code>Array.prototype</code> functions
probably allow you to achieve the same result but in more functional and succinct manner.</p>

<p>Do note that the deferred execution we know from Linq does not apply to <code>Array.prototype</code>!</p>]]></block1>

<h2 id="commonly-used-methods">Commonly used methods</h2>

<h3 id="select--map">Select = map</h3>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// C#
var result = enumerable.Select(x =&gt; x);

// JavaScript
let result = array.map(x =&gt; x);

// Using spread to avoid mutation
const input = [{k: 1, v: true}, {k: 2, v: false}];
const result = input.map(x =&gt; ({...x, v: !x.v}))
</code></pre>

<p>When mapping to an object without code block, you need to wrap your object between extra parentheses like</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">[0, 1].map(x =&gt; ({value: x}));

// Because without the extra parentheses
[0, 1].map(x =&gt; {value: x});
// --&gt; [undefined, undefined]

// it is the same as writing:
[0, 1].map(x =&gt; {
  value: x; // No error, because JavaScript?
  return undefined;
});
</code></pre>

<h3 id="where-distinct--filter">Where, Distinct = filter</h3>

<p><code>Where</code> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter"><code>filter</code></a> behave pretty much exactly alike.
Linqs <code>Distinct</code> we’ll need to implement ourselves.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const input = [0, 0, 1, 5, 5];
// Equals true when the first occurrence of the value is the current value
const result = input.filter((element, index, array) =&gt; array.indexOf(element) === index);
// Or: [...new Set(input)];
expect(result).toEqual([0, 1, 5]);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="aggregate-groupby---reduce">Aggregate, GroupBy, … = reduce</h3>

<p>Linq has Sum, Min, Max, Average, GroupBy, etc.
While JavaScript doesn’t have them, they can all be achieved trivially with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce"><code>reduce</code></a></p>

<!-- [apply](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply) -->

<p><strong>Sum, Min, Max, Average</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const input = [0, 1];
const sum = input.reduce((total, cur) =&gt; total + cur, 0);
const average = sum / input.length;
const min = Math.min.apply(Math, input); // Old school
const min = Math.min(...input); // Using spread
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Aggregate, GroupBy</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const input = [0, 1, 2, 3];

const result = input.reduce((acc, cur) =&gt; {
  if (cur % 2 === 0) {
    acc.even.push(cur);
  } else {
    acc.odd.push(cur);
  }
  return acc;
}, {even: [], odd: []});

expect(result).toEqual({even: [0, 2], odd: [1, 3]});
</code></pre>

<p>Since 2024, JS has a dedicated <code>Object.groupBy</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const socks = [
  { name: 'JavaScript', type: 'lang' },
  { name: 'Angular', type: 'package' },
  { name: 'React', type: 'package' },
];

const grouped = Object.groupBy(socks, sock =&gt; sock.type);

expect(grouped).toEqual({
  lang: [{ name: 'JavaScript', type: 'lang' }],
  package: [
    { name: 'Angular', type: 'package' },
    { name: 'React', type: 'package' },
  ]
})
</code></pre>

<h3 id="slice">slice</h3>

<p>Linq has First, Last, Skip, SkipLast, SkipWhile, Take, TakeLast, TakeWhile.
JavaScript has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice"><code>slice</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Shallow copy
const input = [0, 1, 2, 3];
expect(input.slice()).toEqual([...input]);

// Signature
slice(startIndex = 0, endIndex = length-1);
</code></pre>

<h4 id="c-ranges">C# Ranges</h4>

<pre><code class="language-c#">var array = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

Assert.Equal(new[] { 3, 4 }, array[2..^1]);
Assert.Equal(new[] { 1, 2 }, array[..^3]);
Assert.Equal(new[] { 3, 4, 5 }, array[2..]);
Assert.Equal(new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, array[..]);
</code></pre>

<h4 id="with">with</h4>

<p>Since 2023, there is also <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/with"><code>with</code></a> which returns a new
array where one item is replaced with a new value by index.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const newArr = arr.with(index, newValue);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="mutations">Mutations</h2>

<p>These functions operate in place.<br />
Since ECMAScript 2023, some have non-mutating alternatives!</p>

<h3 id="orderby--sort-and-tosorted">OrderBy = sort and toSorted</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/toSorted">toSorted</a> if you need a new array for the sorted result.</li>
  <li><strong>Without compareFn the array is sorted according to each character’s Unicode code point value.</strong></li>
  <li>The compareFn should return a number:
    <ul>
      <li><code>-1</code> (or any negative number): <code>a</code> comes <strong>before</strong> <code>b</code></li>
      <li><code>0</code>: Equal</li>
      <li><code>1</code> (or any positive number): <code>a</code> comes <strong>after</strong> <code>b</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>The signature is a bit different: <code>OrderBy(Func&lt;TSource, TKey&gt; keySelector, IComparer&lt;TKey&gt; comparer)</code></li>
  <li><code>OrderBy</code> vs <code>OrderByDescending</code>: switch <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>…</li>

<h3 id="foreach">forEach</h3>

<p>While <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach"><code>forEach</code></a> is not really doing any mutation by itself, it is often what it’s used for.
Mutations are especially dangerous in for example a Redux environment where UI changes might lag.
The same can usually be achieved with <code>map</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const input = [{value: 1, visited: 0}, {value: 2, visited: 0}];

// Potentially dangerous
input.forEach(el =&gt; {
    el.visited++;
});

// ...el will create a shallow copy only!
const result = input.map(el =&gt; ({...el, visited: el.visited + 1}));

// Or use the good old loop?
for (let itm of input) {
    console.log(itm.value);
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="keyvaluepipe-impure">KeyValuePipe <small>(Impure)</small></h4>

<p style="float: right"><a href="https://angular.dev/api/common/KeyValuePipe">KeyValuePipe API</a></p>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>Ideally one would create a new gitignored file to configure an application to fit his local development
environment but when you do have to revert to modifying a committed configuration file, at least there is
“git assume unchanged” to avoid committing your changes in these files accidentally.</p>

<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="assume-unchanged">Assume Unchanged</h2>

<pre><code class="language-powershell"># Git assume a file
git update-index --assume-unchanged fileName

# And unassume with
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged fileName
</code></pre>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h3 id="aliases">Aliases</h3>

<p>But who can remember that…<br />
Some handy git aliases without <code>update-index</code> nightmarish syntax to be put in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ini">[alias]
    # Usage: git assume fileName
    assume = update-index --assume-unchanged

    # Usage: git noassume fileName
    noassume = update-index --no-assume-unchanged

    # Another alias because I cannot remember un/no either
    unassume = !git noassume

    # List all currently git assumed files
    assumed = "!git ls-files -v | grep ^h | cut -c 3-"
</code></pre>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>Or create the aliases from the CLI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">git config --global alias.assume "update-index --assume-unchanged"
git config --global alias.noassume "update-index --no-assume-unchanged"
git config --global alias.unassume "update-index --no-assume-unchanged"
git config --global alias.assumed "!git ls-files -v | grep ^h | cut -c 3-"
</code></pre>

<p>One of our other projects <a href="/blog/productivity/git-numbered-add-for-powershell">Git-NumberedAdd</a> allows you to execute these commands with fabricated
indexes instead of filenames.</p>

<h2 id="skip-worktree">Skip Worktree</h2>

<p>I’ve always used assume unchanged but apparently <code>--skip-worktree</code> would be a superior
solution for changes in configuration files because it retains the <code>S</code> flag (as seen with <code>git ls-files -v</code>)
when pulling upstream changes. I’ll find out as upstream changes are a real pain with assumed unchanged.</p>

<!-- TODO: is skip-worktree really better when dealing with changes on origin? -->

<pre><code class="language-powershell">git update-index --skip-worktree fileName
git update-index --no-skip-worktree fileName
</code></pre>

<h3 id="aliases-1">Aliases</h3>

      <title>Angular Road Trip</title>
    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>Today I want to blog about my Angular(2 - 6) experiences the past years.</p>

<p>After 3 years of desktop development I’ve started with Angular 2+ in july 2016, when it was still in beta.</p>

<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="back-then">Back then</h2>

<p>Back then the landscape was a lot more difficult than it is today.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<ul>
  <li>We did not have <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Angular-cli</a> yet, we had to do the packing and configuration ourselves.</li>
  <li>We did not have a lot of documentation, and the one we had was often out of date and misleading.</li>
  <li>Editors(VSCode, Webstorm, VS..) did not cope well with Angular yet. The intellisense was often lacking, inline templates support was lacking, and so on..</li>
  <li>We got Release Candidates that contained major breaking changes. <em>“WTF? <a href="https://semver.org">Semver</a> much?”</em></li>
  <li>Npm equaled pain. Back then even more than now. Packages were often not versioned in a way that made sense.</li>
</ul>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>“expression has changed after it was checked”
One of the interviewing questions I ask candidates is if they know this error message that would pop up in the console window in development mode. 
For me it’s an indicator of their experience with Angular. If you have never seen this error you’ve never gone through hell and back ;)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In the beginning it was still suggested to use SystemJs instead of WebPack.
And then things became silent around SystemJs. The community was dying to hear from the Angular team what they’d choose next as the preferred packing mechanism.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I remember asking the question to Igor Minar myself, one of the Angular project leads, on the first NG-BE conference ever. His eyes rolled to the back of his head. 
Apparently wherever he went people would ask that question and he got tired of it, especially because he could not give a clear answer yet. 
I thought I’d be smart and asked what google is using themselves? Apparently they used their own mechanism. Making a possible answer even more complicated. 
It was not decided that day. But later it was made clear that Webpack would be embraced as the preferred packaging mechanism.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>For me, the most important session at NB-BE was the one given by Todd Moto.
He talked about forms in Angular. A session we welcomed because we had quite a struggle with that. So many possibilities and so little answers. 
Soon we realized that for business applications heavily depending on forms and validations Reactive Forms would be the way to go in most cases. 
But how do you implement it when you have a tree of components who all contain a part of the form and you have only one save button at the bottom of the page? 
I have a solid idea now, but only because it’s the logical result of a road full of trial &amp; error.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="as-of-today">As of today</h2>
<p>I’m still glad I can work with Angular every day.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The framework embraces <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> which is a revelation compared to JavaScript.</li>
  <li>I think it’s a great framework. Especially for full stack developers who can not fully dedicate their time to frontend development.</li>
  <li>It’s a rich and mature framework, still actively developed and each update comes with a lot of nice new features.</li>
  <li>The editors matured as well. Giving (almost) full support to the latest Angular versions.</li>
  <li>Flux implementations(ngrx, ngxs, ..) made it a lot cleaner to manage your data and have a single source of truth.</li>
  <li>You can aim for a minimal startup time and preload lazy loaded modules in the background with just a little configuration.</li>
  <li>Angular supports different configurations for different environments.</li>
  <li>Your code is minimized, uglified, and tree-shaken.</li>
  <li>Angular-CLI gets you going within seconds. You can have a basic shell application built with the Angular framework and thus starting point for your newest project.
<br />
All in all it’s just a great framework for modern web applications and most of the time a joy to work with :)</li>

      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>It’s a feature of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads">SQL Server Express</a>.
Make sure to select it during installation using the <strong>Express Advanced</strong> or <strong>LocalDb</strong> packages.<br />
It can also be installed with the <strong>Visual Studio Installer</strong>. There it is a part of the <strong>.NET desktop development</strong> workload.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>LocalDb can usually be found in</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Tools\Binn\SqlLocalDB.exe
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>130</code> is the version number of SQL Server 2016.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps"># List all instances
SqlLocalDB.exe info | % { SqlLocalDB.exe info $_ }
</code></pre>

<p>The default instance is called <code>(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB</code>.
It can be used as connectionstring for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms">SSMS</a>
or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download">Azure Data Studio</a> using Windows Authentication.</p>

<p>Run <code>SqlLocalDB.exe</code> without arguments to get help on all CLI parameters.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps"># Create a new instance. -s for auto-start
# When "instance name" is omitted, MSSQLLocalDB is used
create ["instance name" [version-number] [-s]]
delete ["instance name"]

# -i request with NOWAIT option. -k kill without contact
stop ["instance name"] [-i|-k]
start ["instance name"]

share ["owner SID or account"] "instance name" "shared name"
unshare|u ["shared name"]

trace|t on|off
versions|v: Lists all LocalDb version-numbers installed
</code></pre>

<p>The data is stored in</p>
<pre><code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server Local DB\Instances
</code></pre>

<h3 id="connectionstring">ConnectionString</h3>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;add name="MyContext"

      <title>Numbered Add</title>
    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p class="notice--info"><strong>🎉🎉 October 2025 update: v1.2</strong><br />
There have been changes in both git (v2.26+) and PowerShell (v7+) that broke
<code>Git-NumberedAdd</code>, it has been a long time coming but, the fixes are finally available in the PSGallery 😅</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>After copying file paths from <code>git status</code> output and pasting them after a <code>git add</code> quite a few times
by now, I’ve written a small <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/Git-NumberedAdd">PowerShell script</a>
to manipulate the working directory and staging area with fabricated indexes.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="powershell-gallery">PowerShell Gallery</h2>

<p>Now available on the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Git-NumberedAdd">PowerShell Gallery</a>!</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps">Install-Module -Name Git-NumberedAdd
</code></pre>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="git-numberedhelp-alias-gnh">Git-NumberedHelp <small>(alias: gnh)</small></h2>

<p>All these aliases to save time but who can remember all that?<br />
Use <code>gnh</code> to display all actions available by Git-NumberedAdd with description and alias.</p>

<h2 id="git-numberedstatus-alias-gs">Git-NumberedStatus <small>(alias: gs)</small></h2>

<p>Displays the output of <code>git status --short</code> together with fabricated indexes like so</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/git-add-numbered-status.png" alt="Git-NumberedStatus" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Working directory color codes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yellow: <span style="color: #CDCB7D"><strong>M</strong></span>odified (file0 to file3)</li>
  <li>DarkMagenta: <span style="color: #8C5998"><strong>D</strong></span>eleted (file4)</li>
  <li>Blue: <span style="color: #0480EF"><strong>A</strong></span>dded (file5)</li>
</ul>

<p>Git-NumberedStatus accepts extra CLI arguments. Example: <code>gs -u</code> to see all <code>--untracked-files</code>.<br />
Configure the color output by modifying <code>$global:gitStatusNumbers</code>.</p>

<h3 id="with-numstat">With Numstat</h3>

<p>If <code>$global:gitStatusNumbers.includeNumstat</code> is true (=by default), Git-NumberedStatus will also
execute a <code>git diff --numstat</code> and add lines added/deleted to the output.</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/git-add-numbered-status-numstat.png" alt="Git-NumberedStatus with --numstat" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h2 id="git-numberedadd-alias-ga">Git-NumberedAdd <small>(alias: ga)</small></h2>

<p>All set to stage some files!</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps">PS&gt; Git-NumberedAdd 0 1 2
add 'file0'
add 'file1'
add 'file2'
</code></pre>

<p>The same can be achieved with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Git-NumberedAdd 0-2</code></li>
  <li><code>Git-NumberedAdd -3</code></li>
  <li><code>Git-NumberedAdd 012</code> (as long as index 12 does not exist!)</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Git-NumberedAdd +3</code> would add file4 and file5 in the above scenario.</p>

<h3 id="and-commit">And Commit</h3>

<p>Provide a final string argument to continue and commit the staged files:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ps">gs
ga 0 1 2 "commit: files 0, 1 and 2"
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-numbereddiff-alias-gd">Git-NumberedDiff <small>(alias: gd)</small></h2>

<p>Works like <code>Git-NumberedAdd</code> but can also be called without arguments to
see the diff of all files. It will call <code>git add -N</code> for all newly created
files so that they also show up in the diff.</p>

<p><code>git diff --cached</code> is currently not implemented in this script.</p>

<h2 id="git-numberedreset-alias-grs">Git-NumberedReset <small>(alias: grs)</small></h2>

<p>This only works for files already staged.
Example output:</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/git-add-numbered-status-staged.png" alt="Git-NumberedStatus" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>To, for example unstage file0 and file4</p>
<pre><code class="language-ps">PS&gt; Git-NumberedReset 02
Unstaged changes after reset:
M       file0
M       file1
M       file2
D       file4
</code></pre>

<h2 id="all-actions">All actions</h2>

<p>Wrappers for all your basic git commands</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell"># Manipulate working directory:
Git-NumberedAdd # Alias: ga
Git-NumberedAddPatch # Alias: gap
Git-NumberedDiff # Alias: gd
Git-NumberedDiffCached # Alias: gdc
Git-NumberedCheckout # Alias: gco

# Manipulate the staging area:
Git-NumberedReset # Alias: grs
</code></pre>

<h3 id="git-assuming">Git-Assuming</h3>

<p>Unfamiliar with “assume unchanged”?
Check the docs on <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index"><code>git update-index --assume-unchanged</code></a>.</p>

<p>After a <code>Git-NumberedStatus</code>, assume a file in the working directory with <code>Git-NumberedAssumed</code> (alias: gas)</p>

<p>Unassume files later on:</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell"># List all currently assumed files
Git-ListAssumed # alias: gasl

# and follow with:
# git update-index --no-assume-unchanged
Git-NumberedUnassumed # alias: gnoas
</code></pre>

<p>There are now also aliases for <code>git update-index --skip-worktree</code> with <code>Git-NumberedHidden</code> (alias: ghide)</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">Git-ListHidden  # alias: glh

# and follow with:
Git-NumberedHidden # alias: ghide
</code></pre>

<h3 id="utilities">Utilities</h3>

<pre><code class="language-powershell"># Get the full path of a file
Git-GetFileNameByIndex 2 # alias: gn

# Delete file with index 2
rm (gn 2)


# Change current path to single index location
Git-NumberedSetLocation # Alias: gsl
# Use Pop-Location (alias: popd) to go back to where you came from
</code></pre>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<p>Sometime similar is actually built into Git itself</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git add --interactive # or -i for short
</code></pre>

<p>Once in interactive mode:</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/git-add-interactive.png" alt="git add --interactive" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>And then use <code>2: Update</code> to stage files.</p>

<p><br />
Also, see below for similar implementations in Bash and Perl.</p>]]></block2>

      <title>Less Pager</title>
    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>A <code>git diff</code> or <code>git log</code> starts the less program. Perhaps not the
fanciest tool but more powerful than you might expect.</p>

<p>This post details the arguments that can be passed to <code>less</code>
and also how to navigate once less is running. Things not relevant
for git are omitted.</p>

<p>Your current configuration:</p>
<pre><code>git config --get core.pager
</code></pre>

<p>If this returns nothing, there is room for improvement there!</p>

<p><strong>TL&amp;DR</strong>:</p>

<p>Configure something sensible:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Short version
git config --global core.pager "less -eFiJM~ -j3 --tabs=3"

# Not so short version
git config --global core.pager "less --LONG-PROMPT --tabs=3 --quit-at-eof --quit-if-one-screen --tilde --jump-target=3 --ignore-case --status-column"
</code></pre>

<p>I first came into contact with Yaml when using Jekyll, where it is used quite extensively.
Aside from Jekyll, it is used for a many things, in Spring, Travis CI, Grav, in the cloud, …
and <a href="http://yaml.org">parsers are available for all languages</a>.</p>

<p>It’s not all <a href="https://github.com/cblp/yaml-sucks">moonshine and roses</a> though as the implementations
tend to yield different results for more exotic inputs (and sometimes also for not so exotic input).</p>

    </toc>
    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>The creators of <a href="https://github.com/nsubstitute/nsubstitute">NSubstitute</a> craved a mocking framework
with comparable capabilities to the alternatives but with a shorter, more succinct syntax.
They have not failed to do so and I loved the NSubstitute syntax right away.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p><br />
The examples assume</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">// Packages:
Install-Package NSubstitute
Install-Package NUnit

// Interface:
interface ICalculator
{
    int Add(int a, int b);
    int Divide(int n, int divisor, out float remainder);
    string Mode { get; set; }
    void SetMode(string mode);
}
</code></pre>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="creating-a-substitute">Creating a substitute</h2>

<pre><code class="language-c#">// For an interface
ICalculator nsub = Substitute.For&lt;ICalculator&gt;();

// For a class
Calculator nsub = Substitute.For&lt;Calculator&gt;(ctorArg1, ctorArg2);
</code></pre>

<p>When substituting a class, only virtual/abstract members can be mocked.<br />
There are generic overloads for up to three different types. When
providing multiple types, max one class can be used. For more than three:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">var sub = Substitute.For(
    new[] { typeof(IComparable), typeof(IDisposable), typeof(ICloneable), typeof(Calculator) },
    new object[] { /* ctor arguments for Calculator */ }
);
Assert.IsInstanceOf&lt;IDisposable&gt;(sub);
Assert.IsInstanceOf&lt;Calculator&gt;(sub);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="matching-arguments">Matching arguments</h2>

<pre><code class="language-c#">// Arg.Any and fixed value
nsub.Add(Arg.Any&lt;int&gt;(), 5).Returns(10);
Assert.That(nsub.Add(999, 5), Is.EqualTo(10));

// Arg.Is: Fixed value and Predicate
nsub.Add(Arg.Is(1), Arg.Is&lt;int&gt;(x =&gt; x &lt; 0)).Returns(5);
Assert.That(nsub.Add(1, -2), Is.EqualTo(5));

// First matcher still applies
Assert.That(nsub.Add(998, 5), Is.EqualTo(10));

// ReturnsForAnyArgs overwrites everything
nsub.Add(0, 0).ReturnsForAnyArgs(100);
Assert.That(nsub.Add(1, -2), Is.EqualTo(100));
</code></pre>

<h2 id="verification">Verification</h2>

<p><strong>Did receive calls:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">// Methods
nsub.Add(0, 1);
nsub.Received().Add(0, 1);
nsub.ReceivedWithAnyArgs().Add(0, 0);

// Property Getter
string call = nsub.Mode;
string result = nsub.Received().Mode;

// Property Setter
nsub.Mode = "BIN";
nsub.Received().Mode = "BIN";

// Reset calls
nsub.ClearReceivedCalls();

// Verify with predicate
nsub.Add(0, 1);
nsub.Add(0, 2);
nsub.Add(0, 3);
nsub.Received(2).Add(Arg.Is(0), Arg.Is&lt;int&gt;(x =&gt; x &lt;= 2));
// In this case the Arg.Is(0) is required by NSubstitute
// (providing 0 directly results in an AmbiguousArgumentsException)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Did not receive calls:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">nsub.DidNotReceive().Add(Arg.Any&lt;int&gt;(), 9);

// The actual arguments to Add are simply ignored with DidNotReceiveWithAnyArgs
nsub.DidNotReceiveWithAnyArgs().Add(0, 0);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="providing-values">Providing values</h2>

<p>Without setup the following is returned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For primitives: <code>default(int)</code></li>
  <li>For strings: <code>string.Empty</code></li>
  <li>For IEnumerables: <code>Enumerable.Empty&lt;T&gt;()</code></li>
  <li>For interfaces: a <code>Substitute.For&lt;T&gt;()</code>, the same reference when called with the same arguments</li>
</ul>

<p>When substituting a class, non-virtual methods returning an interface
cannot be mocked and will return <code>null</code>.</p>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>First we’ll cover the basic Autohotkey hotkey syntax. Which is arguably already pretty confusing for
newcomers in and by itself.<br />
<br />
But we don’t stop there as after adding more and more hotkeys, it will also become harder and harder
to think of new key combinations that are somehow still memorable. There is only so much
you can do with the <code>#</code> (Windows) key etc.<br />
<br />
Time for some creative hotkey combinations! ‘Advanced Hotkeys’ covers code snippets on
how to run different scripts on single, double or triple key presses as well as how to
differentiate between long(ish) key presses or mouse clicks. And more…</p>

<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="example">Example</h2>

^#D::MsgBox Pressed Control + Win + D (%A_ThisHotKey%)

; Control + Win + C: Multi line script

<code>KeyHistory</code> opens a window where you can figure out which is which.</p>

<h3 id="native-function">Native function</h3>

<p>Prefix a hotkey with <code>~</code> to not block the native function.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">#IfWinActive, ahk_class CabinetWClass
; Control + Shift + 6: Details View in Windows Explorer
; Resize columns so that filenames are completely visible
~^+6::Send, {Control Down}{NumpadAdd}{Control Up}
#IfWinActive
</code></pre>

<h3 id="custom-combinations">Custom combinations</h3>

<p>To combine keys that do not have a shorthand use <code>&amp;</code>.
Keys on the left side of such custom combinations lose their native function.
They are called prefix keys.</p>

<p>Example: Search google for text on the clipboard by pressing Capslock and X.</p>
<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">Capslock &amp; X::Run, http://www.google.com/search?q=%clipboard%
</code></pre>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p><strong>Key Down and Up</strong><br />
Add <code>UP</code> to a hotkey combination to run the script on key release rather than on keypress.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">AppsKey::ToolTip Press &lt; or &gt; to cycle through tabs.
AppsKey Up::ToolTip
~AppsKey &amp; &lt;::Send ^+{tab}
~AppsKey &amp; &gt;::Send ^{tab}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Wildcard</strong><br />
<code>*</code> acts as a key modifier wildcard.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">*#c::Msgbox Triggered by Win+C, Shift+Win+C, Ctrl+Win+C, etc
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Resending</strong><br />
<code>$</code> is necessary when you need to send the same hotkey and not execute your script again.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">$#e::
; Send Control + C =&gt; Copy text
Send, ^c
ClipWait, 1
fileExists := FileExist(clipboard)
if (fileExists = "D") {
    ; Open explorer in path on clipboard
    Run % "explorer.exe /root," clipboard

} else if (fileExists) {
    ; Open explorer with file selected
    Run % "explorer.exe /select," clipboard

} else {
    ; No path on clipboard, just open explorer
    Send #e
}
Return
</code></pre>

<h3 id="context-sensitive-hotkeys">Context sensitive hotkeys</h3>

<p>Control in which applications a hotkey is (not) active with the
keywords 
<a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/WinActive.htm"><code>IfWinActive</code></a>, 
<code>IfWinExist</code>, <code>IfWinNotActive</code> and <code>IfWinNotExist</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">#IfWinActive, ahk_class Notepad

<p>Find out the <code>ahk_class</code> of a program with Window Spy (AU3_Spy.exe)
which comes bundled with Autohotkey itself.</p>

<h3 id="combining-2-hotkeys">Combining 2 hotkeys</h3>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">~Esc::

</code></pre>

<p>Gotcha: the <code>A_PriorHotkey</code> will only hold values of combinations that are also defined
as a hotkey. The value of <code>A_PriorHotkey</code> will be exactly as the hotkey is defined.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Follow a hotkey up with an additional keypress</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; AltGr + C: Change the case of the selected text

<h3 id="jasmine-spec-reporter">Jasmine Spec Reporter</h3>

<p>Probably your goto console logger: <a href="https://github.com/bcaudan/jasmine-spec-reporter">jasmine-spec-reporter</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install jasmine-spec-reporter --save-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const SpecReporter = require('jasmine-spec-reporter').SpecReporter;

jasmine.getEnv().clearReporters();
jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new SpecReporter({
  spec: {
    displayPending: true,
    // See configuration.d.ts for more config
    // Colors: https://github.com/Marak/colors.js

<pre><code>module.exports = {
  someLongRunningOperation: function() {
    for (var i = 0; i &lt;= 1000; i++) {}

<p><strong>cut.js</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const webApi = require('./api.js');
module.exports = function() {
  webApi.someLongRunningOperation();
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>spec.js</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const proxyquire = require('proxyquire');
var apiStub = {};
const cut = proxyquire('./cut.js', {'./api.js': apiStub});

describe('fake the api call', function() {

<p>Files included in the <code>jasmine.json</code> “helpers” wildcard(s)

  this.yourHelper = function() {
    return 'as defined';
  };


  // Mock global variables in required modules
  jasmine.getGlobal().t = t =&gt; t;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Some suite:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">describe('Convenience stuff loaded by spec/helpers/helpers.js', function() {
  it('should use myExternalCustomEquality', function() {

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>The basic example contains the general test suite structure and the 
two most used matchers <code>toBe()</code> (===) and <code>toEqual()</code> (deep compare),
followed by all the other matchers that come out of the box.</p>

<p>To finish some helpers for your workflow: how to only have certain
tests run and how to exclude tests.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="basic-example">Basic example</h2>

<p>Time to start writing some real tests with Jasmine!</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">describe('basic example', () =&gt; {
  beforeEach(() =&gt; {
    this.result = 1;
  });

  it('can hardly fail', () =&gt; {
    // toBe() uses ===
    expect(this.result).toBe(1);

    // For primitive types, toEqual
    // behaves the same way as toBe
    // toEqual goes further however
    // by deeply comparing objects.
    expect({a: {}}).toEqual({a: {}});
    expect([0, {a: 1}]).toEqual([0, {a: 1}]);
  });

  afterAll(() =&gt; {});
});
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>describe</code> groups one or more related tests together in a suite. Describes can be nested indefinitely
and contain one <code>it</code> for each test in the suite.</p>

<p><code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code> runs once before/after all tests in the containing describe are executed.
<code>beforeEach</code> and <code>afterEach</code> runs once before/after each test is executed.</p>

<p>The <code>this</code> context is shared in the beforeX/afterX functions and the <code>it</code>s, allowing you to setup/teardown stuff
and access them in your tests.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="matchers">Matchers</h2>

<p>Set expectations with matchers. Usage and differences of <code>toBe</code> and <code>toEqual</code> are already covered
in the basic example above. These are the other matchers:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">it('can negate any matcher with .not', () =&gt; {
  expect(1).not.toBe(0);
});

it('knows about regexes', () =&gt; {
  expect('some bar').toMatch(/bar$/);
  expect('some bar').toMatch('\\sbar');
});

it('can check numbers', () =&gt; {
  expect(5).toBeLessThan(10); // .toBeLessThanOrEqual(5);
  expect(5).toBeGreaterThan(1); // .toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(5);

  const precision = 3;
  expect(Math.PI).toBeCloseTo(3.142, precision);
});

it('has some special matchers', () =&gt; {
  expect(1).toBeTruthy();
  expect('').toBeFalsy();
  expect().toBeUndefined();
  // .toBeNull(); .toBeDefined(); .toBeNaN();
  // .toBeNegativeInfinity(); .toBePositiveInfinity();
  // .toHaveClass(domEl): contains the class
  // .withContext('show this on failure');
  

it('gets funky with partial matchers', () =&gt; {
  expect(['a', {b: {}}]).toContain({b: {}});
  expect('some string').toContain('some');

  expect({bar: 'baz', ack: 'yaye'}).toEqual(jasmine.objectContaining({bar: 'baz'}));
  expect([1, 2, 3]).not.toEqual(jasmine.arrayContaining([1, 6]));
  expect({foo: 'foobarbaz'}).toEqual({foo: jasmine.stringMatching('baz$')});

  // jasmine.arrayWithExactContents()
  // .empty(); .notEmpty();
  // .truthy(); .falsy();
});

it('can check for errors', () =&gt; {
  const foo = () =&gt; {
    throw new TypeError('foo bar baz');
  };

  expect(foo).toThrow();

  // Error message must be exact match in order to pass
  expect(foo).toThrowError('foo bar baz');
  expect(foo).toThrowError(/bar/);
  expect(foo).toThrowError(TypeError);
  expect(foo).toThrowError(TypeError, 'foo bar baz');

  expect(foo).toThrowMatching(err =&gt; err.message.includes('baz'));
});

it('jasmine.any', () =&gt; {
  expect({}).toEqual(jasmine.any(Object));
  // Number, Boolean, Date, String, Array
  // Or 'YourType'
});

it('jasmine.anything', () =&gt; {
  expect(1).toEqual(jasmine.anything());
});
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/src/core/matchers">matchers source</a> for if you’d like to take a peek at the implementations.</p>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>If you are iterating over the same test(s) you can temporarily run these tests by prefixing
one or more <code>describe</code> and/or <code>it</code>s with an f.
You can also execute a single file from the CLI <code>jasmine src/someSpec.js</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously you’ll never want to do the opposite: exclude a test from the suite. But.. If you must, it is possible
to temporarily disable a describe/it by prefixing it with an x.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">// f = focused
fdescribe('only my its will run', () =&gt; {
  it('which is me', () =&gt; {});
  it('and me', () =&gt; {});
  xit('but not me', () =&gt; {});
});

xit('I will not run, even if the fdescribe above is removed', () =&gt; {});
</code></pre>

<p>Other helpers available in an <code>it</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>pending(string)</code>. An <code>it</code> where the second parameter is omitted is automatically pending.</li>
  <li><code>fail(string | Error)</code></li>
</ul>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>Probably the most widely used JavaScript testing framework.</p>

<p>This tutorial covers installation, configuration and execution only.
For the Jasmine syntax, see parts 2 to 4!</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<p>Add Jasmine to your project:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save-dev jasmine
./node_modules/.bin/jasmine init
</code></pre>

<p>You can omit the <code>./node_modules/.bin/</code> if you have Jasmine installed globally.
The following code snippets will assume you did.</p>

<p>If you have no clue how to start, some <strong>working examples</strong> can be created with <code>jasmine examples</code>.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="configure">Configure</h2>

<p><code>jasmine init</code> creates <code>./spec/support/jasmine.json</code> where you can configure your testing preferences.
If you want to put the jasmine.json file somewhere else, you can do so 
by providing a value for the environment variable <code>JASMINE_CONFIG_PATH</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "spec_dir": "spec",
  "spec_files": [
    "**/*[sS]pec.js"
  ],
  "helpers": [
    "helpers/**/*.js"
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>The default Jasmine configuration makes the assumption that 
all tests are placed in <code>./spec/</code> and are suffixed with <code>spec.js</code>.
Helpers (not covered here) allow you to provide custom matchers in your tests.</p>

<p>If you want to place your tests closer to the actual code they are testing, you can
simply change <code>spec_dir</code>. If the source code is in <code>./src</code> use the following spec_dir values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>src/**/spec</code>: The tests for <code>/src/path/to/file.js</code> would be in <code>/src/path/to/spec/fileSpec.js</code>.</li>
  <li><code>src</code>: To place the tests in the same folder as the source files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that paths in the json are relative to where <code>jasmine init</code> was executed.</p>

<h2 id="run">Run</h2>

<p>Run the tests with a simple <code>jasmine</code> or add to your package.json:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">"scripts": {
  "test": "jasmine",
  "test:w": "nodemon --exec \"npm test\"",
  "test:alt": "jasmine JASMINE_CONFIG_PATH=spec/support/jasmine-alt.json",
  "test:cli": "jasmine --filter=\"describe and/or it\" --stop-on-failure=true --no-color --random=true -seed=7337"
},
</code></pre>

<p>And start once with <code>npm test</code> or just <code>npm t</code>. Or start watching with <code>npm run test:w</code>.</p>

<p><code>test:w</code>(atch) requires a <code>npm install --save-dev nodemon</code> to work.</p>

<p><code>test:alt</code> and <code>test:cli</code> demonstrate the available Jasmine CLI parameters.</p>

<h2 id="transpile">Transpile</h2>

<h3 id="babel">Babel</h3>

<p>Node can handle most syntax you throw at it, but if you do use
something too fancy, <a href="http://babeljs.io/docs/setup">Babel</a> to the rescue!</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save-dev @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node

# Add all the presets/plugins you're using
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env @babel/polyfill core-js
</code></pre>

<p>Add all the presets/plugins to your <code>.babelrc</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
</code></pre>

<p>File <code>run-jasmine.js</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">import '@babel/polyfill';
import 'core-js/shim';
import Jasmine from 'jasmine';

const jasmine = new Jasmine();
jasmine.loadConfigFile('./spec/support/jasmine.json');
jasmine.execute();
</code></pre>

<p>The accompanying code has a working example for Babel transpilation in the <code>babel</code> folder.</p>

<h4 id="building-and-watching">Building and watching</h4>

<p><code>package.json</code> scripts:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">"scripts": {
  // Clean generated files (requires npm i -D del-cli)
  "babel:clean": "del-cli dist",

  // Transpile to dist directory
  "babel:build": "babel babel --out-dir dist --ignore some-generated-dir/",

  // Clean, build and run jasmine
  "babel": "npm run babel:clean &amp;&amp; npm run babel:build &amp;&amp; node babel/dist/run-jasmine.js",

  // Watch for changes
  "babel:w": "nodemon --exec \"npm run babel\" --ignore babel/dist/"
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>

<p><code>ts-node</code> to the rescue!<br />
Make sure you change your <code>jasmine.json</code> file extensions to <code>.ts</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --save-dev jasmine @types/jasmine typescript ts-node cross-env
</code></pre>

<p><code>jasmine.json</code> content:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "spec_dir": "spec",
  "spec_files": [
    "**/*[sS]pec.ts"
  ],
  "helpers": [
    "helpers/**/*.ts"
  ],
  "stopSpecOnExpectationFailure": false,
  "random": true,
  "reporters": [
    {
      "name": "jasmine-spec-reporter#SpecReporter",
      "options": {
        "displayStacktrace": "all"
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>package.json</code> scripts:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">"scripts": {
  "test": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--loader=ts-node/esm jasmine",

  // -e ts: reload on file extension ts
  "test:w": "nodemon -e ts --exec \"npm test\""
}
</code></pre>]]></block2>

<h2 id="miscellaneous-features">Miscellaneous features</h2>

<p>EPPlus can do a whole lot more for you. This post covers some interesting stuff that didn’t really fit anywhere else.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">// Set workbook properties like title, author, company, ...
OfficeProperties props = package.Workbook.Properties;

// Modify column props: AutoFit(), Hidden, ...
var colE = package.Workbook.Worksheets.First().Column(5);

	var header = sheet.HeaderFooter.OddHeader;
	// &amp;24: Font size
	// &amp;U: Underlined

	sheet.PrinterSettings.RepeatRows = sheet.Cells["1:2"];
	sheet.PrinterSettings.RepeatColumns = sheet.Cells["A:G"];

	sheet.View.PageLayoutView = true;

	package.SaveAs(new FileInfo(@""));
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="comments--richtext">Comments &amp; RichText</h3>

<p>Each RichText.Add() returns a new object that takes over all styling from the textobject is was invoked on
and can then be styled separately.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">using (var package = new ExcelPackage())
{
	var sheet = package.Workbook.Worksheets.Add("Rich Comments");

	comment.AutoFit = true;

	ExcelRichText rt = comment.RichText.Add("Unbolded subtext");
	rt.Bold = false;
	// Also rt.Color, FontName, Size, ...

	// A more extensive example can be found in Sample6.cs::AddComments of the official examples project
	// https://github.com/JanKallman/EPPlus/blob/master/SampleApp/Sample6.cs

	package.SaveAs(new FileInfo(@""));

      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="ienumerable-objects">IEnumerable objects</h2>

<p>Exporting data to an Excel doesn’t get easier than this</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">using (var package = new ExcelPackage())
{
	var sheet = package.Workbook.Worksheets.Add("IEnumerable");
	var data = new[]
	{
		new {Name = "A", Value = 1},
		new {Name = "B", Value = 2},
		new {Name = "C", Value = 3},
	};
	bool generateHeaders = true;
	sheet.Cells["A1"].LoadFromCollection(data, generateHeaders);

	// Overwrite headers with something fancier
	sheet.Cells["A1"].SetHeaders("Name", "Value");
	package.SaveAs(new FileInfo(@""));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which would result in the following xlsx.</p>

<table class="table-excel">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>Value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There are overloads for</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing headers or not</li>
  <li><code>TableStyles</code>: Style the table in one of the predefined formats</li>
  <li><code>BindingFlags</code> + <code>MemberInfo</code>: Allow you to export specific (private) fields</li>
</ul>

<p>The pretty blue background for the header is done with an extension method.
The LoadFromXXX methods do not set any header styling themselves.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">public static void SetHeaders(this ExcelRangeBase cell, params string[] headers)
{
	foreach (string text in headers)
	{
		cell.Value = text;
		cell.Style.Font.Bold = true;
		cell.Style.Fill.PatternType = ExcelFillStyle.Solid;
		cell.Style.Fill.BackgroundColor.SetColor(Color.DarkBlue);
		cell.Style.Font.Color.SetColor(Color.White);

		cell = cell.Offset(0, 1);
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>LoadFromArrays</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c#">using (var package = new ExcelPackage())
{
	var sheet = package.Workbook.Worksheets.Add("Arrays");
	var data = new[]
	{
		new[] {"A1", "B1", "C1"},
		new[] {"A2", "B2", "C3"},
	};
	sheet.Cells["A1"].LoadFromArrays(data);
	package.SaveAs(new FileInfo(@""));
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="csv-file">CSV file</h2>

<pre><code class="language-c#">using (var package = new ExcelPackage())
{
	var sheet = package.Workbook.Worksheets.Add("CSV");
	var file = new FileInfo("LoadFromText.csv");

	var format = new ExcelTextFormat()
	{
		Delimiter = ',',
		Culture = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,

		// Escape character for values containing the Delimiter
		// ex: "A,Name",1 --&gt; two cells, not three
		TextQualifier = '"'

		// Other properties
		// EOL, DataTypes, Encoding, SkipLinesBeginning/End
	};
	sheet.Cells["A1"].LoadFromText(file, format);
	package.SaveAs(new FileInfo(@""));
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="datareader--datatable">DataReader &amp; DataTable</h2>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I find Moqs <code>Func&lt;T1, T2, ...&gt;</code> overloads they have provided for <code>.Return</code> very useful.
NSubstitute requires some more typing to achieve the same <code>.Return</code> capabilities but 
you do get to treat methods and properties alike compared to Moq who’s stuck with <code>VerifyGet</code>.
Because of this NSubstitute got better discoverability inside an IDE while Moq
continues to struggle with a whole bunch of deprecated ways of doing things.</p>

<p>The drop of <code>.Setup()</code> and <code>.Object</code> for <strong>all</strong> cases is very win for NSubstitute.</p>]]></block2>

<p>Quick tutorial about creating xlsx Excels with
C# and the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/EPPlus">EPPlus nuget package</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EPPlus Excel addresses are not zero based: The first column is column 1!</p>

<p>Also, before writing any loops, you might want to check out the <code>LoadFromXXX</code> methods.
They are explained in depth in part 3 Import.</p>

<p>The blog posts will only cover the most important functionality.

<h1 id="autohotkey-extensions">Autohotkey Extensions</h1>

<p>Add missing stuff yourself with Autohotkey.<br />
Find <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/Mi-Ke/tree/master/scripts-windows-explorer">the source for the Autohotkey scripts here</a></p>

<p>Execute shortcut code only when Windows Explorer is active:</p>
<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">SetTitleMatchMode Regex
#IfWinActive ahk_class CabinetWClass|ExploreWClass|Progman|WorkerW
; "ahk_class CabinetWClass|ExploreWClass" executes in Windows Explorer
; "ahk_class Progman|WorkerW" executes on Desktop
#IfWinActive
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Some of the scripts use the following methods.
They are defined in <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/Mi-Ke/blob/master/scripts-windows-explorer/windows-explorer-util.ahk">windows-explorer-util.ahk</a>.</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; Get the currently active path
Explorer_GetPath()

; Get the currently selected file(s)
Explorer_GetSelected()
</code></pre>

<h3 id="hijacking-windows--e">Hijacking Windows + E</h3>

<p>If the selected text while pressing Windows E is a path,
open Windows Explorer in that specific path.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">~#e::

; Send Control+C

ClipWait, 3
clipVal := clipboard

; Does the copied text contain a path?

} else {
    ; Simply open explorer
    Send #e
}

; Restore the clipboard
clipboard := oldClip
Return
</code></pre>

<h3 id="zip-directory">Zip directory</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/Mi-Ke/blob/master/scripts-windows-explorer/windows-explorer-zip-directory.ahk">Ahk source</a> for creating a zip file with the contents of
the current directory or the currently selected files.</p>

<h3 id="create-new-file">Create new file</h3>

<p>One creates a new directory with Control + Shift + N but there is not really one for
creating a new file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; Control + Shift + F: New file
^+f::
DeselectSelectedFiles()
Send {Appskey}
Send w
Send t

; Control + Shift + T: New txt file

	{
		; If no file is selected, ^Space may actually select it
		; after which {AppsKey} will open the wrong ContextMenu
		Send ^{Space}
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p><strong>Change extension dialog</strong>:<br />
Windows doesn’t offer an option to not show a confirmation dialog
when changing the extension of a file. The best we can do is wait
and whenever one pops up click it away?</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">While, 1
{
    WinWaitActive, Rename ahk_class #32770
    Send y
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Details View</strong>:<br />
While <code>Control + Shift + 6</code> is probably very useful, pesky Windows
might truncate longer filenames with the switch to Details View.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; Control + Shift + 6: Details View
; ~ = Do not block native function
~^+6::
; Resize columns so that filenames are completely visible
Send {Control Down}{NumpadAdd}{Control Up}
Return
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Closing</strong>:<br />
Closing an Explorer window can be done with Alt+F4 or with Control+W.
But when you want to close it after Windows annoyed you, this scrips allows you
to do so by hitting Esc hard, twice.</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">~Esc::
If (A_PriorHotKey = A_ThisHotKey and A_TimeSincePriorHotkey &lt; 500)
	WinClose

Return
</code></pre>
<p>(I guess I just didn’t know about Control + W before this post:)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Alternatives</strong>:</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://alternativeto.net/software/windows-explorer">AlternativeTo Windows Explorer</a>, many people like Total Commander.</p>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>A cheat sheet outlining the syntax differences between VB.NET and C#. This post is written
specifically for advanced C# developers with little to no VB.NET knowledge who need to do
some VB.NET coding.</p>

<p class="notice--info">Because some things are just so similar but still confusingly different in VB.NET vs C#…</p>

<p>Along the way we’ll make some amazing discoveries like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are things VB.NET just can’t do (pointers, …)</li>
  <li>There are a few cases where VB.NET code is <em>shorter</em> than its C# counterpart (gasp!)</li>
  <li>VB.NET defaults are not what you might expect from a strongly typed language due to its VB6 legacy (Option Strict, Explicit)</li>
  <li>There is some VB.NET only stuff that comes in handy from time to time</li>
</ul>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="confusingly-different">Confusingly different</h2>
<p>Or some fun issues during heavy context switching :)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Terminating statements with <code>;</code> in VB.NET or not using <code>_</code> for line continuations.</li>
  <li>Compare with <code>=</code> in C# or with <code>==</code> in VB.NET (and <code>!=</code> vs <code>&lt;&gt;</code>)</li>
  <li>VB.NET is <em>not</em> case sensitive</li>
  <li>Arrays in VB.NET are 1 based</li>

It’s (surprise surprise) more typing than <code>And/Or</code> but the latter don’t short-circuit
the evaluations. Ex: <code>If x IsNot Nothing And x.Trigger() Then</code> will crash.</p>

<p>The only real blocker against VB.NET is unsafe and checked/unchecked code.
But if you really need to be working unsafely, perhaps you should consider not using .NET.</p>

<p>There is other C# only stuff that has already been covered (ex: Out parameters) and there is more like multi line comments
and <code>a++</code> but nothing serious that can’t be worked around with some additional statements in VB.NET.</p>

<p>This somewhat changes with C# 7 features that have not been implemented for VB.NET:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Out variables: <code>int.TryParse(s, out var i)</code></li>
  <li>Pattern Matching: <code>o is int i</code>, switch</li>
  <li><code>return ref x;</code></li>
  <li>Tuples</li>

  <li>Like operator for simple string matching</li>
  <li>Static local variables</li>
  <li>Modules: Which can be (sort of) emulated with <code>static class</code> and static using statements.</li>

		&lt;Title&gt;Xml Literals&lt;/Title&gt;
		&lt;Items&gt;
			&lt;Item Type="Date"&gt;&lt;%= Datetime.Now %&gt;&lt;/Item&gt;
			&lt;Item Type="String"&gt;Whoah&lt;/Item&gt;
		&lt;/Items&gt;
	 &lt;/Root&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can even build Xml with dynamic node names and by meshing in some Linq.
It’s probably more a thing for migration and test code and not so much for production code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-vb">Dim persons = 
	&lt;Persons&gt;
		&lt;%= From p In persons Select &lt;Person&gt;&lt;%= p.Name %&gt;&lt;/Person&gt; %&gt;
	&lt;/Persons&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Getting stuff out of XElement is also very nicely done:</p>
<pre><code class="language-vb">Dim title = xml.&lt;Root&gt;.&lt;Title&gt;.Value
Dim nowNode = xml...&lt;Item&gt;.First()
Dim nowTypeAttribute = nowNode.@Type
Dim nowNodeText = nowNode.Value
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conversion-troubles">Conversion troubles</h2>
<p>While there are some online converters, they are not at all up to date, or very smart.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.carlosag.net/tools/codetranslator/">Carlosag converter</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://converter.telerik.com/">Telerik converter</a> &lt;- If you must, take this one</li>
</ul>

<p>They do not provide much more than a starting point.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using an array accessor in VB.NET (<code>arr(0)</code> vs <code>arr[0]</code>) results in an incorrect translation</li>
  <li>“Newer” features, like lambdas are converted to dynamic, or not at all</li>
  <li>Use any VB.NET or C# only feature and they won’t even make an attempt at converting it</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><strong>So which is best</strong><br />
(just kidding:)</p>

<p>VB.NET used to be lacking many convenient C# features (using, yield, …). While it has mostly catched up, 
C# proves to be a moving target.</p>

<p>Properties used to be a real pain in VB.NET. A one liner syntax is now available like
<code>Property Start As Date</code>. But by now C# already introduced property expression bodies
leaving VB.NET behind again.</p>

<p>For a long time VB.NET switch statement used to be more versatile but with the implementation of Pattern Matching
in C# this is no longer the case.</p>

<p>Lambda syntax like <code>o.Where(Function(x As Integer) x &lt; 0)</code> isn’t going to win any prizes when camped against
C#’s <code>o.Where((int x) =&gt; x &lt; 0)</code>… But at least it’s there :)</p>

<p>I’m probably a <em>little</em> biased towards C# because of the more succinct syntax and because the vast majority of
online examples are written in C# while the free conversion tools are severely lacking.</p>

<p>It’s perhaps worth mentioning that VB.NET and Resharper are not on the best of terms.</p>

<p>Unless you really need some of the VB.NET or C# only features, choosing one over the other should probably
still be a team decision.</p>]]></block2>

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>Working with environment variables in Windows is as easy as:</p>
<pre><code>Win + Pause &gt; "Advanced system settings" &gt; "Environment Variables..."
</code></pre>
<p>After which you get a tiny, unresizable, form where you can view and manage them.
Something better eventually arrived with Windows 10 but still, PowerShell :)</p>

<p>Use Autohotkey to open the window with <code>Left Alt + Pause</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">LAlt &amp; Pause::Run % "rundll32 sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables"
</code></pre>]]></excerpt>

<pre><code class="language-powershell"># Listing all environment variables

env

# Or just those containing path
Get-ChildItem Env:*PATH* | Format-List

# Display a specific one (case insensitive)
$env:PATH
[environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "Process")

# They are the union of
# Machine: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment
[environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "Machine")
# User: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment
[environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User")
</code></pre>

<p>In cmd.exe, all envs can be listed with <code>set</code>.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="managing-environment-variables">Managing environment variables</h2>

<pre><code class="language-powershell"># Managing current session environment
$env:test = "value"
Remove-Item Env:test

# Persistent registry management (registry)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("yaye", "value", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("yaye", "$null", "User")

# Requires RunAs Admin
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("yaye", "value", "Machine")
</code></pre>

<p>When using the PowerShell <code>$env:key = "val"</code>, the environment changes are available only for the current session.
When using the .NET <code>[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable</code>, the changes are persisted to the registry
but they do not become available in the current session.</p>

<p>A helper function to the rescue!</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">Set-Alias se Set-Environment

function Set-Environment([String]$key, [String]$value) {
	[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("$key", "$value", "User")
	Set-Item -Path Env:$key -Value $value
}
</code></pre>

<p>Already opened processes, tabs, etc won’t see these environment changes.
The environment can be refreshed from the registry however.</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">Set-Alias re Refresh-Environment

function Refresh-Environment {
	$locations = 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment', 'HKCU:\Environment'
	$locations | ForEach-Object {

		$k.GetValueNames() | ForEach-Object {

	}

	# Put Machine and User $env:PATH together
	$machinePath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "Machine")
	$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User")
	$Env:PATH = "$machinePath;$userPath"
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have chocolatey installed, <code>RefreshEnv</code> will also work.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="envpath-helpers">$env:PATH helpers</h2>

<p>Use <code>fp</code> to list all directories in <code>$env:path</code>.
It accepts a search needle as parameter. ex: <code>fp node</code>.</p>

put quotes around directories containing spaces.</p>

<p>There is (unfortunately) no way to configure the “Default project” in the PMC. This workaround creates a Verb-RealNoun
for each existing cmdlet and adds a short alias to these commands. Which project contains the migrations is by convention,
as determined by <code>$isLikelyDbContextProject</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Attention</strong>:<br />
This completely ignores whatever may be the last migration that was applied to the database.
Having <code>Update-RealDatabase -1</code> go back to the “last <em>applied</em> migration - 1” instead of the current implementation
“go to the second last migration added to the project”, would require analysing <code>Get-Migrations</code>, which would make the whole

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> is great! I’m pretty sure you’ve already heard of it but for those who have not: It allows you to synchronize about 2 gig
(and up to 16 gig with some effort) worth of documents, pictures or other files between your different computers, laptops or other
mobile devices. The files are kept on your machine(s) and in the cloud, but they are also accessible from anywhere with a browser
and shareable with everyone you’d like.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>While it is very nicely integrated with Windows, one little caveat is that additional directories outside the Dropbox main folder can’t
be synchronized out of the box.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/junction">Junction</a>, a free download from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">sysinternals.com</a>,
fixes this problem. Once a junction between an existing directory and a new one somewhere inside the Dropbox folder has been established, any change 
to either directory gets immediately synchronized with Dropbox…</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="to-create-a-junction">To create a junction.</h2>

<p>The first parameter is the directory you want to create, the second parameter is the existing directory you want to link. Windows changes
the icon of a junction folder to indicate its nature but when you have linked to a Dropbox folder, it is overwritten by the Dropbox
synchronization icons. You could move the actual directory to Dropbox and link to the original location if you want the junctions to be visible
in Windows explorer.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">junction "newlyCreatedJunctionPath" "existingOriginalPath"
junction "C:\Users\Documents\Dropbox\www" "c:\wamp\www"
</code></pre>

<h2 id="to-list-all-existing-junction-points">To list all existing junction points</h2>

<p>Use <code>–s</code> for recursive search and <code>–q</code> to stop displaying access denied stuff. Aside from you custom made links this will also display
a whole bunch of already made junction points related to the current Windows account.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">junction -s -q c:\
</code></pre>

<h2 id="to-delete-an-existing-junction">To delete an existing junction.</h2>

<p>Deleting an entire junction folder will keep the original directory intact. So it’s probably easier to just delete the junction point in Explorer.
If you want to get rid of everything, merely deleting the original directory will leave the junction “hanging”.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">junction -d "C:\Users\Documents\Dropbox\www"

    <excerpt><![CDATA[<p>Built-in in Notepad++ since 2016:</p>

<p><strong>Settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Delimiter &gt; Add you character as part of word &gt; $</strong></p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<h2 id="old-broken-and-obsolete-autohotkey-solution">Old, Broken and Obsolete Autohotkey solution</h2>

<p>My previous editor Code-Genie already selected the $ sign along with the variable name when I double clicked somewhere
on a word. When I upgraded to Notepad++, I was confused this was no longer happening as it seemed pretty obvious to me that
when writing PHP almost always you’d want the $ also. Apparently not that many agree, but I want that behavior so I checked
the StackOverflow answers. The follow up answer provides a workaround using a Notepad++ macro and an Autohotkey script.
The problem is that it requires you to use a special keybinding (alt+click) to trigger the macro.
I still want my Code-Genie feeling back.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>With Notepad++ seemingly letting us down, I was sure it was Autohotkey to the rescue:</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; Also select the $ when control clicking a word in a Notepad++ PHP file
^LButton::
WinGetActiveTitle, windowTitle
isNotepadPhpFile := RegExMatch(windowTitle, "\.[pP][hH][pP] - Notepad\+\+$")
if isNotepadPhpFile
{
    Send, ^{Click}
    return
}
 
; Selects the word the cursor is on plus an extra character on the left
Click
Send, ^{LEFT}{LEFT}+{RIGHT}^+{RIGHT}
return
</code></pre>

<p>Wait… You promised a double-click solution and now post code bound to control+click, what’s going on here?
Well, I cracked out some code – literally having to lookup every keyword along the way – until I got to the
point where I decided to continue the fight another day. I got to a solution with the following problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The cursor is jumping around because I’m sending keystrokes.</li>
  <li>Clicking twice in succession but on different lines is interpreted as a double click.</li>
  <li>You have to wait a little between double and triple clicks (select entire line) for this to work correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will update the code to fix these issues and revisit this post then. Here is the already “somewhat-workable code” :)</p>

<pre><code class="language-autohotkey">; Also select the $ when double clicking a word in a Notepad++ PHP file
~LButton::
WinGetActiveTitle, windowTitle
isNotepadPhpFile := RegExMatch(windowTitle, "\.[pP][hH][pP] - Notepad\+\+$")
if !isNotepadPhpFile
    return
 
if (A_PriorHotkey &lt;&gt; "~LButton" or A_TimeSincePriorHotkey &gt; 300)
{
    ; Too much time between clicks, so this isn't a double-click.
    ; Flawed: If you click twice in succession on different rows
    ;         it thinks it's a double click while really it is not.
    KeyWait, LButton
    return
}
 
; 1: Less jumping doesn't preserve the cursor position
; 0: More jumping. You actually see the cursor moving (even more:)
settingLeastCursorJumping = 1
 
; Selects the word the cursor is on plus an extra character on the left
IfEqual settingLeastCursorJumping, 1, Send, ^{LEFT}{LEFT}+{RIGHT}^+{RIGHT}
IfNotEqual settingLeastCursorJumping, 1, Send, {RIGHT}^+{LEFT}+{LEFT}
 
; Resets the cursor position if the first character isn't $
var := GetCurrentlySelectedText()
if (InStr(var, "$") = 0)
{
    IfEqual settingLeastCursorJumping, 1, Send, {RIGHT}^{LEFT}^+{RIGHT}
    IfNotEqual settingLeastCursorJumping, 1, Send, +{RIGHT}
}
return
 
; Capture and return selected text to clipboard
; Restore clipboard's value after CTRL+C
GetCurrentlySelectedText()
{
    oldClipboard = %Clipboard%
    Send, ^c
    selectedText = %Clipboard%
    Clipboard = %oldClipboard%
    return selectedText
}
</code></pre>]]></block2>

      <block2><![CDATA[<div style="clear: both"></div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>All bookmarks can be cleared from the “Search –&gt; Bookmark” menu. There are some more related options in that
menu which might even seem pretty odd at first.
That is until you combine them with the “Mark” tab in the “<strong>Find Dialog (CTRL + F)</strong>”.</p>

<p><img src="https://itenium-be.github.io/blog-posts-new/assets/blog-images/notepad-bookmarks-2.jpg" alt="Inverse Bookmark, say what?" /></p>

<p><br />
Suddenly you can write a regular expression to capture certain lines of text and cut those lines with a single command. Pretty neat!</p>

  <p>“<em>Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.</em>”<br />
— The Pragmatic Programmers</p>
</blockquote>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>Dave and Thomas mantra is the old IBM corporate motto “THINK!”:
While working, do not ever stop questioning what you are doing.
<em>Think!</em> about opportunities to improve the way you work.
Any manual task is prone to error and often recurring tasks can probably be automated.
Find ways to refine your skills and always be on the lookout for new adventures.</p>

<p>One such adventure to make you stronger is learning about Design Patterns.
And a great way to learn more about patterns is by <a href="https://github.com/itenium-be/Talk-DesignPatterns">teaching about them</a>.</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<h2 id="learning-design-patterns">Learning Design Patterns</h2>

<p>How do you convince a developer unfamiliar with Design Patterns to pick up a book on the topic. There are a few amazing books about
Design Patterns out there of which <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>
is the one most often recommended. 
Now, there are many (semi-)technical books out there that are not only educational but fun to read also. That one, however interesting,
is not one of them. So outright advising to pick it up might not be a good idea, certainly not if this developer hasn’t read much before.
Starting with a book about perhaps at first seemingly irrelevant or rarely applicable concepts might quickly result in a “BOOORING” feeling
(and resulting in the book being thrown in some corner to gather dust.) Try convincing this person afterwards about another “amazing” IT book!</p>

<p>It is for this reason that I always have some reserve about recommending Design Patterns. It might be better to warm them up to the idea
and usefulness of patterns first and, if you manage to pique their interest, then tell them about the Gang of Four patterns book.<br />
You could start with saying that patterns are actually more a means of communicating in the team. Adding the name of the pattern to the name 
of the type for example facilitates communication between maintainers. Any time you use the name of such proven pattern, the intent, motivation
and consequences of using it are all communicated with just one word.</p>

<p>If the developer has had some design experience, you could continue with that no doubt she will already know and have used some of the patterns
described in the book. Then is the moment to present a few of the more common patterns with the aim to get that “Aha!” reaction when a certain pattern
sinks in. Begin perhaps with explaining (arguably) the easiest pattern of them all: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern">Template Method</a>.
Or if the developer is sometimes falling in the
procedural trap of excessively repeated if/else, typeof or switch statements (lists that seem to grow with every other new requirement), you might want
to explain how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy</a> (a.k.a. Policy) could solve these
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle">Open/Closed Principle</a> violations instead.</p>

<p>And finally we are back where we started: “Think! About Your Work”</p>

<p>When learning about patterns, one must be careful to think of them as a new tool available to use when required, not as the new way of doing things
– as is in fact the case with all new things learned. A well designed system can incorporate many patterns used together but we must always be careful
(<em>Think!</em>) when applying a pattern or risk overusing them, applying them without fully understanding the consequences or we might even unconsciously
start molding problems to fit a pattern (Just to be able to implement it now?:). Probably even more important than the patterns themselves, the risks
should always be clearly communicated when introducing someone to design patterns.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-no-absolute-truths">There are no absolute truths</h2>

<p>Another way to approach “selling” the GoF Design Patterns book to someone would be by not sampling the patterns themselves but by illustrating
that the patterns are often implementations of two underlying principles of object-oriented design (described in much detail in section 1.6 of their
book “How Design Patterns Solve Design Problems”.) These principles are “<strong>Program to an interface, not an implementation</strong>” and “<strong>Favor object composition
over class inheritance</strong>”. I never quite understood why these principles are so hidden in the book (I once searched for like 20 minutes for them) instead
of in some big fat font as I believe that if someone were to just remember two things from the book, it should be those principles.</p>

<p>What happens when someone sees “Program to an interface, not an implementation” and takes it as an absolute truth is that systems get designed where
half of the Types are Interfaces and the other half are (in most cases) their only implementation. Due that one sentence, the next project I inherited had
its Types almost doubled.</p>

<p>Pretty please <em>Think!</em>, if there is only one implementation required and there is no apparent reason for a second one to be ever needed, do not define
an interface for the sake of defining an interface. Unnecessary types clutter the project with unneeded complexity. Everything in a system should have
a purpose. If you have only interfaces that are actually implemented multiple times then when you see an interface, it is practically shouting at you
“hey look at me, interesting stuff is happening here!”. The code does not communicate this when there are interfaces for normal and special cases alike.
Besides, the simpler a project remains, the better. It’ll get plenty of complexity anyhow, there is no reason to be adding some Types already for
functionality that is not (yet) required.</p>

<p>If you have knowledge of the domain and/or know the product owner well, you might be able to predict the ways the design needs to be flexible but
unless you are absolutely certain it will be required do not add it. I’d like to already refer to Pragmatic Tip 51: “<strong>Don’t Gather Requirements–Dig
for Them</strong>”, if you <em>Think!</em> flexibility might be required, try to verify this with a domain expert before implementation. As you get to know the domain
and the product owner(s) better, you’ll be able to make better and better judgments regarding what the next feature requests will be.</p>

<p>Of course, it is possible a second implementation does become required where no interface was created. Change is inevitable and some refactoring is
going to be necessary. But when was the last time you added an interface or feature “just in case” that actually ended up being required and could
be used AS IS? Chances are slim that an API will be able to handle all requirements (they were unknown!) without refactoring. Or it can preserve the
signature but introduce a hack. Certainly at the beginning of a project, when the specs are not exactly frozen (or even not yet existing), all object
structure and relations are constantly in movement. And in the end, even things that were never ever – ever – going to change end up changing quite a
lot (and back and forth). Dave &amp; Thomas have the remedy for any headache this “flexibility” might incur to you at your work place: 
Pragmatic Tip 14: “<strong>There Are No Final Decisions</strong>” . This also works the other way. If you provided hooks for extensibility and they turn out not to be
required, the unneeded complexity can always be taken back out. No regrets. Plus I like to delete dead code.</p>

<p>Next up is “Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses”, one of my favorite tips!</p>]]></block2>

  <p>“Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?”<br />
— The Pragmatic Programmers</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="hide-from-excerpt" id="yet-another-blog">Yet Another Blog</h2>

<p>Scott Hanselman said “<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx">Now, go write, create, commit.</a>”.
It took a while but here we are, blogging about “Programming and stuff”. I will be writing about languages and platforms
I’m working on or learning about, solutions to problems I’ve struggled with and really any CS related topic I’m otherwise curious about.</p>]]></excerpt>
      <block1><![CDATA[<p>The intention is to actively work and log on Andrew Hunt’s and Dave Thomas’ “<a href="https://pragprog.com/tips">Pragmatic Tips</a>”,
a set of 70 tips, each designed to help you become a better programmer as presented in their 
– already much appraised – book “The Pragmatic Programmer”.</p>

<h2 id="care-about-your-craft">Care About Your Craft</h2>

<p>Their very first Pragmatic Tip “<strong>Care About Your Craft</strong>”” goes without saying. If you don’t enjoy communicating with the business
(why put that first you ask…), trying to come up with solutions that work for both camps, if you don’t care about fighting code-rot
and are not even trying to become a better professional but instead have to drag yourself to work each day to write code “by coincidence”
only for that very same code to come back to haunt and derive you from your sleep during maintenance, then perhaps you should try 
to find something else? Why torment yourself like this when there are very likely jobs out there that you would in fact enjoy!?</p>]]></block1>
      <block2><![CDATA[<p>In all professions, new things need to be learned as processes are refined or replaced, and this is especially true in our branch. 
You might currently be a specialist in a mainstream language such as Java or c# and while these won’t be outdated anytime soon, 
the keyword here should be “currently”. Like everything in IT, these languages will eventually disappear as newer and cooler languages 
are being introduced, languages that perhaps utilize a new programming paradigm that completely changes the way we think about code or 
languages that provide us a new level of abstraction enabling us to get things done faster with less and easier to understand code.</p>

<p><br />
For those, like you and me, who care deeply about our craft these now-unattainable levels of boosted productivity sound attractive
indeed even if it means having to learn a whole new paradigm. We’re more inclined to be happy about this turn of events: A whole new
community opens up for which not yet any library or framework exists. Those who program only to pay the bills most likely don’t follow
Pragmatic Tip 8: “<strong>Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio</strong>”, and are slowly becoming obsolete as everyone and everything but them evolves.</p>]]></block2>
