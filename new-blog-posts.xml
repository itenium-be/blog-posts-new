<p>At the core of our Security Bootcamp lies the conviction that the
most effective defense is a well-informed and proactive offense.</p>

<p>Our workshop takes the form of a team-based game, where participants
accumulate points by uncovering vulnerabilities in our websites
(such as SQL Injection, XSS, and more).</p>

<p>Boost your team’s score by tackling puzzles and brain-teasers,
employing a diverse set of IT tools.</p>]]></block1>

<p>After successfully executing a specific hack, our program includes a
comprehensive PowerPoint presentation that delves into the intricacies
of the vulnerability, along with its associated risks and how it was
exploited during the game.</p>

<p>We outline the attack vector and provide invaluable guidance for your developers,
equipping them with essential tips and insights for developing secure APIs
and web applications.</p>

<p>Your testers learn how to perform fundamental security tests to ensure
no unauthorized data access or manipulation is possible by crafting
custom requests.</p>

<p>Our presentations also serve as eye-openers for product owners and managers,
shedding light on the potential catastrophic consequences of these vulnerabilities
and the ease with which they can be exploited, using readily available tools.</p>

<p>To drive the message home, we conclude our presentations with real-world examples,
showcasing how renowned companies and products have fallen victim to these
vulnerabilities time and again, often resulting in significant financial repercussions.</p>
